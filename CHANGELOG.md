## [1.10.0] – 2026-03-30 (Latest)

### 🏗️ Key Storage Refactor — `.env` as Single Source of Truth

- **Removed Redis key storage** — provider API keys were previously stored in both `.env` (at startup) and Redis (added via UI), requiring an explicit "Save to .env" step to persist them across restarts
- **Keys now written directly to `.env`** on every add/remove operation via the UI
- `_read_env_keys()` / `_write_env_keys()` parse `.env` fresh on each call — changes take effect immediately without a restart or Redis sync
- **Auto-creates `.env` from `.env.example`** if no `.env` exists when the first key is added
- Removed `sync-env` endpoint and "Save to .env" button (no longer needed)
- **Delete button shown for all keys** — all keys live in `.env` and are all removable via the UI
- Redis is now used **only** for rate-limit counters and provider disabled/enabled flags

### 🔧 Provider Enable/Disable Flow

- **Test-before-enable** — when the enable toggle is switched on, Arbiter first calls the enable API then immediately runs a connectivity test
  - If test **passes**: provider stays enabled; latency and reply shown in the card
  - If test **fails**: provider is auto-disabled back; toggle reverts; error shown in red — ensures no provider is active with a broken key
- **Fixed stale DOM bug** in `addKey()` — after adding a key, `loadProviders()` re-renders the card grid; the validation result was being written to a detached (removed) DOM node and was invisible. Now re-queries the result element after the re-render.

### ✨ Playground — Markdown Rendering in Chat

- **Assistant chat bubbles now render GFM markdown** using `marked.js v9`
  - Headers, bold, italic, code blocks, inline code, lists, blockquotes, tables, links all rendered as HTML
  - Links open in new tab
  - User messages remain plain text (HTML-escaped)
  - Responsive markdown styles for all elements inside `.chat-msg.assistant`

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- **Modal vLLM startup crash** (`tokenizers` incompatibility) — `tokenizers>=0.21.0` removed `all_special_tokens_extended` which vLLM 0.11.x still accessed; fix: force-reinstall `tokenizers==0.20.3` as a separate image layer after vLLM install
- **Modal `startup_timeout`** increased from 600s to 1200s to accommodate large model downloads
- **Modal live deployment status** — added 5-second polling loop (`setInterval`) when Modal GPU tab is open; previously the deployment list was loaded once and never refreshed
- **Modal endpoint not appearing after deploy** — `loadModalEndpoints()` was only called on tab open; now also called when deployment reaches `active` state and on every 5s poll tick
- **Pollinations image generation 401** — `/v1/images/generations` was not in `_EXEMPT_PATHS`; browser UI requests don't carry Bearer tokens; added it and all UI page routes to exempt list
- **Lightning.ai / Z.ai keys not activating** — both providers were missing from `_reload_provider`'s `_classes` dict; keys were saved but providers were never instantiated; added `LightningProvider` and `ZaiProvider`

### 🎨 CSS / Responsive Fixes

- **Added 5 missing semantic CSS alias variables** to both light and dark themes: `--danger`, `--success`, `--warning`, `--text-1`, `--text-muted` — these were used in 24+ inline styles across pages but never defined, causing invisible/fallback rendering
- **Mobile 480px breakpoint** — added rules to collapse inline `1fr 1fr` grids to single column, fix `#providers-grid` in api-docs, adjust playground chat height

---

## [1.9.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Lightning.ai Provider (LitAI)

- **New provider: Lightning.ai** (`app/providers/lightning_provider.py`)
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://lightning.ai/api/v1`
  - **Natively hosted open-weight models** (not available elsewhere):
    - `nvidia/nemotron-3-super` — 256K context, ultra-fast (446 t/s)
    - `lightning-ai/gpt-oss-120b` — flagship 120B model
    - `deepseek/deepseek-v3.1` — 164K context
    - `lightning-ai/gpt-oss-20b` — efficient 20B
    - `meta/llama-3.3-70b` — 128K context
  - **Free tier**: ~37M token welcome credit on signup; then $0.09–$0.52/M tokens
  - **Authentication**: `Authorization: Bearer LIGHTNING_API_KEY`
  - Config: `LIGHTNING_API_KEYS=` in `.env`
  - Integrated into routing, key pool, models API, settings UI

### 🔧 Modal.com — Critical vLLM Template Fix

- **Fixed broken `_VLLM_TEMPLATE`** in `app/api/modal_deploy.py`:
  - **Root cause**: `allow_concurrent_inputs=MAX_CONCURRENT` inside `@app.cls(...)` was **removed in Modal 1.0** (May 2025) — all deployments failed silently
  - **Fix**: Replaced entire template with the official Modal 1.0 pattern:
    - `@app.function(...)` instead of `@app.cls(...)`
    - `@modal.concurrent(max_inputs=MAX_CONCURRENT)` as a separate decorator (Modal 1.0 replacement)
    - `@modal.web_server(port=8000, startup_timeout=600)` instead of `@modal.asgi_app`
    - vLLM runs as a **subprocess** (`subprocess.Popen(["vllm", "serve", ...])`) — uses vLLM's built-in OpenAI-compatible server
    - vLLM version bumped: `>=0.6.0` → `>=0.8.0`; Python 3.11 → 3.12
    - Removed heavyweight deps no longer needed in-process (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `transformers`)
  - The deployed endpoint serves `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/health` natively via vLLM
- **Updated GPU prices** (Modal reduced prices since original implementation):
  - T4: $0.36/hr → **$0.59/hr** ($0.000164/s)
  - A10G: $0.72/hr → **$1.10/hr** ($0.000306/s)
  - A100-40GB: $2.16/hr → **$2.10/hr** ($0.000583/s)
  - A100-80GB: $3.40/hr → **$2.50/hr** ($0.000694/s)
- **Added GPU options**: L4 ($0.80/hr) and L40S ($1.95/hr) to `_GPU_MAP` and model catalog
- **Added new model options**: Qwen 2.5 7B on L4 (sweet spot), DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B on T4 (cheapest reasoning)
- **Fixed templates in `modal_manager.py`**: Updated example code to use correct Modal 1.0 patterns; corrected GPU pricing table

---

## [1.8.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Analytics Dashboard (`/analytics`)

- **New dedicated analytics page** — deep usage metrics with Chart.js visualizations
  - Summary KPI cards: total requests, tokens, errors, cache hit rate
  - Per-provider breakdown table: requests, tokens, errors, error rate
  - Per-model breakdown table: per-model request / token / error counts
  - Request history line chart: 5-minute bucket time-series (last 2 hours by default)
  - Provider distribution doughnut chart
  - Reset button to clear all counters
- **Per-model stat tracking in router** (`app/routing/router.py`):
  - `model:{name}:requests` — request count per model
  - `model:{name}:tokens` — token usage per model
  - `model:{name}:errors` — error count per model
  - `history:{bucket}:requests/success/errors` — 5-minute bucket time-series
- **New API** (`app/api/analytics_api.py`):
  - `GET /analytics/data` — returns summary, providers, models, and history arrays
  - `DELETE /analytics/reset` — clears all `arbiter:stats:*` keys
- **Route registered** in `main.py`

### ✨ Dynamic Gateway Token Management (Settings → Gateway Keys)

- **New Gateway Keys tab** in Settings UI — create, revoke, and delete API tokens from the admin panel
  - Token name + optional expiry datetime
  - Plaintext key shown once on creation; copy button provided
  - Revoke (soft-disable) or permanently delete individual tokens
  - Env-var keys shown as a count note; coexist seamlessly with UI-created tokens
- **Tokens active immediately** — no restart required; `GatewayAuthMiddleware` reads `app.state.gateway_tokens` on every request
- **New API** (`app/api/gateway_tokens_api.py`):
  - `GET /api/gateway/tokens` — list tokens (keys masked)
  - `POST /api/gateway/tokens` — create token, returns plaintext key once
  - `DELETE /api/gateway/tokens/{id}` — permanently delete
  - `PATCH /api/gateway/tokens/{id}` — update name / expiry / active flag
  - `POST /api/gateway/tokens/{id}/regenerate` — rotate the key
- **Auth middleware updated** (`app/middleware/auth.py`) to merge static env keys with dynamic `app.state.gateway_tokens`
- **Startup restoration** — `load_gateway_tokens_to_state()` called in `lifespan()` to reload tokens from Redis on restart

### ✨ Playground — Vendor + Model Drill-Down Selection

- **Two-level model picker** in Playground (`/playground`):
  - Vendor dropdown → model dropdown with metadata badges
  - **Free / paid badge** per model (OpenRouter `:free` suffix detection, provider-level free tier flags)
  - **Rate limits displayed**: RPM, TPM, RPD on model selection
  - **Context window** shown per model
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/models/info` (`app/api/models_api.py`):
  - Returns per-vendor model catalog with rate limits from `PROVIDER_LIMITS` and `VENDOR_MODEL_HIERARCHY`
  - Only configured/active vendors returned
  - OpenRouter free model detection via `:free` suffix

### ✨ Dedicated Image Generation Page (`/images`)

- **New standalone page** `static/images.html` — no longer redirects to Settings
- Left panel: prompt, negative prompt, model selector (from `/v1/images/models`), count 1–4, size selector, seed, enhance toggle
- Right panel: image grid with per-image download / open / copy-URL buttons
- Settings persisted in `localStorage`
- Route `/images` now serves `images.html` directly (previously redirected to `/settings?tab=images`)

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Logs expansion state** preserved across auto-refresh — uses stable `seq` ID instead of array index; expanded rows stay expanded as new records load
- **Image Generation nav link** fixed across all pages (`/dashboard`, `/playground`, `/logs`, `/settings`, `/api-docs`, `/analytics`) — was incorrectly pointing to `/settings` with a `localStorage` tab trick

---

## [1.7.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Z.ai (Zhipu GLM) Provider — Free Tier Support

- **New provider: Z.ai / Zhipu AI** (`app/providers/zai_provider.py`)
  - **Free models**: GLM-4.7-Flash, GLM-4.5-Flash, GLM-Z1-Flash ($0 — completely free)
  - **Context window**: 32K–128K tokens (flash models)
  - **Free-tier limits**: ~10 RPM, ~1000 RPD (verify on z.ai/manage-apikey/rate-limits)
  - **API base**: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
  - **OpenAI-compatible**: Same format as other providers

- **Additive Capacity**: GLM-4.7 is now accessible via TWO independent providers:
  - **Cerebras-hosted** `zai-glm-4.7` → 30 RPM (via Cerebras API)
  - **Z.ai-hosted** `glm-4.7-flash` → ~10 RPM (via Z.ai API)
  - **Combined**: ~40 RPM total for GLM-4.7 class requests
  - Router includes both vendors; overlapping models sum their rate limits

- **Audit findings**: Checked all cross-vendor overlaps:
  - Kimi on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate providers)
  - Llama-4-scout on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Qwen on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Mistral on OpenRouter+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Gemma-3 on OpenRouter+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - GLM-4.7 on Cerebras+Z.ai ✅ (now fixed with Z.ai provider)

### 🐛 Router & Cohere Fixes

- **Vendor pin no longer falls back to other providers**:
  - Before: `?vendor=cohere` would try Cohere, then silently fall back to Gemini on failure
  - After: `?vendor=cohere` returns error if Cohere fails (no hidden fallback)
  - Respects user's explicit provider selection
  - Code: `app/routing/router.py:374` — return `[vendor]` only, not `[vendor] + others`

- **Cohere v2 Chat API — System Message Fix**:
  - Before: System messages were extracted from message array and sent as top-level `payload["system"]` field → 422 "unknown field" error
  - After: System messages stay in the messages array with `role: "system"` (Cohere v2 format)
  - Removed extraction pattern; all roles (system/user/assistant) now pass through directly
  - Code: `app/providers/cohere_provider.py:56` — simplified `_build_cohere_messages()` method

### 📊 Key Pool & Rate Limit Fixes

- **Daily counter now tracks requests, not tokens**:
  - Before: `daily_used = 10 + 290 = 300 tokens` after 2 requests → exhausted (daily_limit=33) → locked for 24h
  - After: `daily_used = 1 + 1 = 2 requests` → plenty of room (daily_limit=33)
  - Root cause: All `PROVIDER_LIMITS.daily` values are requests-per-day (RPD), not tokens
  - Fixed: Use `incr` (by 1) for daily, keep `incrby(tokens)` only for TPM
  - Code: `app/key_management/key_pool.py:174` — `record_usage()` method

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Fixed CSS variables** across playground and logs pages:
  - Corrected: `--surface-1` → `--surface`, `--text-muted` → `--text-3`, `--text-primary` → `--text`, `--text-secondary` → `--text-2`
  - Root cause: Pages used wrong variable names; CSS fallback is `initial` → transparent backgrounds
  - All 8 instances updated in both pages' style blocks

- **Fixed layout classes** in HTML structure:
  - `main.main-content` → `div.main-wrapper`
  - `h1.topbar-title` → `h1.page-title`
  - `div.topbar-actions` → `div.topbar-right`
  - `div.content-inner` → `div.page-content`
  - Root cause: Pages didn't match arbiter.css class names

- **Fixed sidebar toggle**:
  - Before: Button had `onclick="toggleSidebar()"` (undefined function) with no `id`
  - After: Button has `id="sidebar-toggle"`, no onclick attribute; arbiter.js wires via event listener
  - Sidebar toggle now works on playground and logs pages

- **Fixed JavaScript errors**:
  - Removed undefined `initTheme()` call (arbiter.js auto-applies theme)
  - Replaced `showToast()` with `toast()` (correct arbiter.js function name)
  - Improved error message fallback to show HTTP status code instead of empty "Error: Error"
  - Code: `static/playground.html:399`, `static/logs.html:496`, `static/logs.html:520`

- **Added responsive CSS**:
  - Tab bar now scrollable on mobile: `overflow-x: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
  - Button size variants: `.btn-sm`, `.btn-xs`, `.btn-danger-ghost`
  - Playground responsive layout for ≤768px: sidebar + chat stack vertically
  - Code: `static/arbiter.css` additions

### 📝 Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Updated provider count (8 → 9), added Z.ai to feature list and rate limits table
- **Configuration docs**: Added `ZAI_API_KEYS` env var documentation
- **Architecture diagram**: Updated provider flowchart to include Z.ai
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This section

## [1.6.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🛠️ CF Workers — Stale-Delete Fix
- **Fixed stale workers after deletion**: After a successful DELETE, a Redis deletion marker (`arbiter:cf:deleting:{name}`, 120s TTL) is set. `list_workers` checks this set and suppresses those workers during the Cloudflare API propagation delay (up to 2 minutes).

### 🔀 CF Workers & Modal — Gateway Routing
- **`cfworker/{name}` model prefix**: Any request to `/v1/chat/completions` with `model: cfworker/<worker-name>` is intercepted before the IntelligentRouter and proxied directly to that worker's `workers.dev` URL via httpx.
- **Virtual models in `/v1/models`**: Active CF workers are exposed as `cfworker/{name}` (owned_by `cloudflare-worker`) and active Modal deployments as `modal/{name}` (owned_by `modal`). Clients can pick these in any OpenAI-compatible tool.

### 🎮 Chat Playground (`/playground`)
- New full-screen chat UI reachable at `/playground` and from the sidebar.
- **Endpoint selector** — grouped dropdown across: Gateway Providers, Cloudflare Workers (live from registry), Modal Deployments (live from registry), Modal Endpoints (registered).
- **Config panel** — system prompt, temperature slider, max tokens.
- **Routing logic per endpoint type:**
  - `cfworker:` → `POST /v1/chat/completions` with `model: cfworker/{name}` (goes through gateway auth)
  - `modal:` with URL → direct `POST {url}/v1/chat/completions`
  - `gateway:` → `POST /v1/chat/completions?vendor={name}`
- **Latency badge** on every assistant message.
- Keyboard shortcut: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.

### 📋 Log Viewer (`/logs`)
- New in-memory log viewer at `/logs` with real-time access to all application logs.
- **`LogBuffer`** Python logging handler (thread-safe deque, max 5,000 records) attached to root logger at startup — captures every module's output.
- **Filters**: level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL), logger name prefix, text search (300ms debounce), time range (since/until).
- **Controls**: tail (last N), limit (100–5000), sort newest/oldest, auto-refresh (2s–30s), copy to clipboard, download as `.txt`, clear buffer.
- **REST API**: `GET /logs/records`, `GET /logs/loggers`, `DELETE /logs/clear`.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- Fixed `DeprecationError: container_idle_timeout` → renamed to `scaledown_window` in Modal vLLM template (deprecated 2025-02-24).
- Modal token auto-loaded from `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` env vars; cached to Redis on first use.

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated CHANGELOG, README, DEVELOPER.md, USERGUIDE.md with all Phase 3 features.

---

## [1.5.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🛠️ Cloudflare Workers — List & Delete Fixes

- **Fixed stale cleanup race condition**: Newly created workers are now stored in Redis with `status: "provisioning"`. The list endpoint respects a 120-second grace period so workers won't be incorrectly removed from the registry while the CF API is still propagating them.
- **Provisioning state visible in UI**: Workers show a "◌ Provisioning…" badge immediately after creation and auto-refresh every 3 seconds until CF confirms the worker.
- **Improved delete**: Optimistic UI update hides the worker immediately on successful DELETE; detailed CF API error messages (including 403 permission denied) are shown in a toast.
- **Better error messages**: CF API errors now extract the human-readable `errors[].message` from the JSON response body, not the raw HTTP body.
- **Workers sorted newest first**: Deployed workers list is now sorted by `created_on` descending.

### 🔑 API Key Validation (all providers)

- **New endpoint: `POST /cloudflare/validate`** — Checks three Cloudflare token permissions without side effects:
  - `Workers Scripts Read` → listing and managing worker scripts
  - `Workers AI Execute` → AI inference
  - `Workers Subdomain` → enabling workers.dev routing
  - Returns a permission matrix with HTTP status codes, notes, and recommendations.
- **Auto-validate on key add**: When a Cloudflare key is added in Settings → API Keys, the UI automatically runs permission validation and displays a ✅/❌ matrix per permission.
- **Validate button**: Existing Cloudflare keys can be re-validated anytime via the "Validate Permissions" button on the provider card.
- **Generic test on add**: Other providers (Gemini, Groq, etc.) run the existing `POST /api/providers/{name}/test` probe immediately after a key is saved, showing latency and a sample response.

### 🚀 Modal.com — One-Click vLLM Deploy

- **New endpoints:**
  - `POST /modal/deploy` — Start a background deployment (returns `deploy_id` immediately)
  - `GET /modal/deploy` — List all deployments with status
  - `GET /modal/deploy/{id}` — Deployment status + live log lines (poll every 2s)
  - `DELETE /modal/deploy/{id}` — Stop Modal app + remove from gateway pool
  - `POST /modal/deploy/account` — Save Modal account token (ak-id:secret)
  - `GET /modal/deploy/account` — Check token status
  - `GET /modal/deploy/models` — Curated catalog (10 models, T4→A100-80GB)
  - `GET /modal/deploy/check` — Verify Modal CLI availability + token configured
- **Pre-flight check**: `POST /modal/deploy` now validates `modal` CLI is in PATH before starting; returns a clear 400 error with install instructions if missing.
- **CLI status banner**: Modal GPU tab shows a warning banner if `modal` CLI is not found or no account token is configured.
- **Cost-optimised vLLM template**: `modal.Volume` weight caching, `@modal.concurrent`, `container_idle_timeout`, `gpu_memory_utilization=0.90`.
- **Auto-registration**: On deployment success, the endpoint URL is automatically registered in the Modal endpoint pool and gateway key pool — no manual step.
- **Live log streaming**: Deployment logs streamed to Redis; frontend polls `GET /modal/deploy/{id}` every 2s.

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with all v1.4 and v1.5 changes
- `DEVELOPER.md` — new API endpoints documented
- Cloudflare `cloudflare_manager.py` docstring updated with required token permissions
- `modal_deploy.py` docstring documents all routes and deployment flow

### 🎨 Settings UI — CF Workers & Modal GPU tabs

- CF Workers: model dropdown from live CF API, analytics button, URL display with copy, active/no-route badge
- Modal GPU: endpoint registration, test, delete; vLLM deployment template
- Models tab: fixed blank model names (was treating `{model, context_window}` dict as array)

---

## [1.3.0] – 2026-03-28

### ✨ Runtime API Key Management (no restart required)

- **New endpoint group: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/providers/*`**
  - `GET /api/providers` — list all providers with status, masked keys, pool stats
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/keys` — add a key at runtime (stored in Redis)
  - `DELETE /api/providers/{name}/keys/{hash}` — remove a runtime-added key
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/enable` — re-enable a disabled provider
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/disable` — take a provider offline without restart
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/test` — probe provider connectivity and measure latency
  - `POST /api/providers/reload` — hot-reload all key pools from env + Redis

- Keys added via the UI are stored in Redis (`arbiter:runtime:keys:{provider}`) and
  merged with `.env` keys automatically; no container restart needed.
- Enable/disable state stored in Redis (`arbiter:runtime:disabled:{provider}`).
- Env-var keys are shown as read-only (source: `env`); runtime keys can be deleted.

### 🖼️ Image Generation (Pollinations.ai — free, no key required)

- **New endpoints:**
  - `POST /v1/images/generations` — OpenAI-compatible image generation
  - `GET /v1/images/models` — list available image models
- Backed by Pollinations.ai FLUX models: `flux`, `flux-realism`, `flux-anime`, `flux-3d`, `flux-cablyai`, `turbo`
- Supports: prompt, negative prompt, model, size (up to 2048×2048), count (1–4), seed, AI enhance
- Returns image URLs (Pollinations renders lazily on first access)
- Completely free — no API key, no credit card

### 🎨 Settings UI — Full Overhaul

- **API Keys tab** (new, shown first):
  - Per-provider cards with status badge, enable/disable toggle, test button
  - Masked key list with source label (`env` or `runtime`)
  - Add key form with format hint per provider
  - Inline Cloudflare setup guide with step-by-step instructions
  - Sign-up links per provider
- **Image Generation tab** (new):
  - Live image generator UI backed by Pollinations
  - Model, size, count, seed, negative prompt, enhance controls
  - Generated images shown as clickable grid with download links
  - API endpoint reference panel
- **Reload Providers** button in topbar (calls `/api/providers/reload`)
- Cloudflare Workers tab: setup banner shown when CF keys not configured

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- Added `app/api/keys_api.py` (new) — provider management router
- Added `app/api/image_api.py` (new) — image generation router
- `app/main.py` — registers `keys_router` and `image_router`
- `app/middleware/auth.py` — exempts `/api/providers/*` and `/v1/images/models` paths

---

## [1.2.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🎨 Enterprise UI/UX Overhaul

- **Shared design system** — `static/arbiter.css` and `static/arbiter.js` loaded by all pages
  - Consistent CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, radius, shadows
  - Sidebar (240 px fixed), topbar (56 px), main content area
  - KPI cards, chart grid, stat rows, progress bars, tables, badges, drag list, toast, tabs, accordion
- **Light / Dark mode**
  - System preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`)
  - Manual toggle persisted in `localStorage` (`arbiter-theme`)
  - Applied immediately on `<html>` before paint (no FOUC)
- **Unified single-site navigation** — identical sidebar across all three pages
- `app/main.py` — added `StaticFiles` mount at `/static/`
- `app/middleware/auth.py` — exempt paths starting with `/static/`

### 📊 Dashboard (`/dashboard`) — Rewrite

- 4 KPI cards: Total Requests, Success Rate, Cache Hit Rate, Cached Entries
- Chart.js **line chart** (request history, 20 data points stored in `localStorage`) + **doughnut chart** (provider distribution)
- Provider Status table with health badges
- **Key Details accordion** — per-provider, collapsible; shows hash, status badge, score bar, RPM/TPM/daily mini-bars
- 10-second auto-refresh via `/dashboard/stats`
- Live status pill and last-update timestamp in topbar

### 📚 API Docs (`/api-docs`) — Rewrite

- 5-tab layout: Overview, Authentication, Endpoints, Playground, Providers
- **Live playground** — vendor/model select, temperature slider, system/user messages, response panel with token usage
- Providers tab loads real data from `/settings/routing`
- Model list loads from `/v1/models`

### ⚙️ Settings (`/settings`) — New page

- **Routing tab** — drag-to-reorder provider priority list
- **Models tab** — per-provider model hierarchy management (add/remove/reorder)
- **Cloudflare Workers tab** — list, create, delete deployed Workers
- **Cache tab** — stats display + clear cache button

### 🛠️ Settings Management API

- `GET /settings/routing` — current routing config (provider order + model overrides)
- `POST /settings/routing` — save custom provider order and/or model overrides to Redis
- `DELETE /settings/routing` — reset to built-in defaults
- `DELETE /settings/cache` — clear all `arbiter:cache:*` keys from Redis

### 🔧 Router — Runtime Config Support

- `IntelligentRouter` reads custom config from Redis (`arbiter:config:provider_order`, `arbiter:config:models:{provider}`)
- 30-second in-memory cache on router to avoid per-request Redis reads
- `_provider_order()` and `_model_hierarchy()` accept optional `cfg` dict from Redis

### 🚫 Cache-Control Headers

- All HTML endpoints (`/dashboard`, `/api-docs`, `/settings`) now return:

### ✅ Multi-Account Key Pool Management

- **Support multiple API keys per provider** — Distribute load across accounts
- **Weighted Availability Scoring Algorithm**:
  - Daily remaining quota: 50% weight (most critical)
  - RPM headroom: 30% weight
  - TPM headroom: 20% weight
  - Score formula: `(rpm_avail × 0.30) + (tpm_avail × 0.20) + (daily_avail × 0.50)`
- **Automatic key selection** — Pick the key with highest score
- **Per-key rate-limit tracking** — Redis-backed sliding windows:
  - RPM: 60-second rolling window
  - TPM: 60-second rolling window
  - Daily: 24-hour window
- **Graceful degradation** — Failed keys get 5-minute cooldown
- **Per-key stats** — View usage, quotas, and health in dashboard

### ✅ Intelligent Two-Level Routing Engine

**Level 1: Provider Selection**
- **Token-aware**: Large contexts (>100K tokens) → Gemini; Medium (16K+) → Gemini/OpenRouter; Small (<4K) → Groq
- **Capability-aware**: Code tasks → Gemini Pro / Groq 70B; General → Gemini Flash
- **Explicit routing**: Model name contains "gemini" → use Gemini; "llama" → Groq, etc.
- **Default priority**: Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter → Cohere

**Level 2: Model & Key Fallback**
- **Model hierarchy per vendor** — Try best fit first, fall back through hierarchy
- **Key rotation** — Try all accounts for same model before moving to next model
- **Cross-vendor fallback** — Only move to next vendor after exhausting current one
- Example flow:
  ```
  Gemini flash (account 1) → Gemini flash (account 2) → Gemini pro → Groq → OpenRouter → Cohere
  ```

**Model Hierarchies** (by vendor):

*Gemini (1M context):*
1. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (fastest, highest quota)
2. `gemini-2.5-flash` (balanced)
3. `gemini-2.5-pro` (highest quality)

*Groq (131K context):*
1. `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fastest)
2. `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (best quality)
3. `llama-4-scout-17b` (newest)
4. `qwen/qwen3-32b` (high RPM)
5. `moonshotai/kimi-k2` (high RPM)
6. `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
7. `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

*OpenRouter (128–131K context):*
1. `llama-3.3-70b:free` (quality)
2. `hermes-3-405b:free` (size)
3. `gemma-3-27b:free` (quality)
4. `mistral-small-3.1:free` (balanced)
5. `gemma-3-12b:free` (lighter)
6. `qwen3-4b:free` (fast)
7. `llama-3.2-3b:free` (smallest)

*Cohere (128–256K context):*
1. `command-r7b-12-2024` (fastest)
2. `command-r-08-2024` (balanced)
3. `command-r-plus-08-2024` (best quality)
4. `command-a-03-2025` (newest)

### ✅ Semantic & Exact-Match Caching (Redis)

- **Cache all responses** with `temperature ≤ 0.3` (deterministic)
- **SHA-256 hash key** based on model + messages
- **Configurable TTL** — Default 1 hour (3600s)
- **In-memory fallback** — Gateway works without Redis
- **Instant cache hits** — Same request returns cached response instantly
- **Transparent to client** — Caching is automatic
- **Cache stats** — Dashboard shows hit rate, size

### ✅ Production-Ready Observability

**Web Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
- Dark-themed, auto-refreshing every 10 seconds
- **Top KPIs**: Total requests, success rate, cache hit rate, cached responses
- **Request breakdown**: Total, successful, failed
- **Cache statistics**: Hits, misses, hit rate, stored responses
- **Per-provider table**: Name, status (healthy/degraded/unavailable), active accounts, requests, success rate, models
- **Per-account table** with per-key details:
  - Account hash (anonymized)
  - Status badge (active/limited/failed/exhausted)
  - **Availability score** (0–100%) with color-coded progress bar
  - RPM usage bar (used/limit)
  - TPM usage bar (used/limit)
  - Daily token usage bar (used/limit)

**JSON Stats API** (`/dashboard/stats`)
- Programmatic access to all dashboard data
- Real-time counters

**Health Check** (`/health`)
- Status: online/degraded
- Redis connection status
- Active providers list
- Version info

**Logging**
- Structured logging to stdout/stderr
- Configurable log level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR)
- Request timing in response headers (`X-Response-Time-Ms`)

### ✅ Docker & Containerization

**Dockerfile**
- Based on `python:3.12-slim`
- Minimal footprint
- Secure defaults (no root)

**Docker Compose**
- Two services: `gateway` + `redis`
- Redis persistence with AOF mode
- Health checks on both services
- Bind mounts for live code reload (dev)
- Automatic service dependency management

### ✅ Rate-Limit Protection

- **Per-provider conservative limits** in `PROVIDER_LIMITS`
- **Per-key sliding-window tracking** (RPM, TPM, daily)
- **Hard exclusions** for:
  - Expired daily quotas (wait until next day)
  - Failed keys on 5-minute cooldown
- **Soft throttling** for RPM saturation (delay/queue within same minute)
- **Graceful fallback** when a key hits limits:
  - Try next best key (same model)
  - Try next model in hierarchy
  - Try next provider
- **Error transparency** — Clear error messages about rate limits

### ✅ Configuration & Secrets Management

- **Environment-based configuration** (`.env` file)
- **No hardcoded secrets** — All keys from env vars
- **Multi-key support** (comma-separated)
- **Per-provider customization**:
  - Redis URL
  - Cache TTL
  - Log level
  - API key pools
  - Optional gateway authentication

### ✅ API Key Security

- **Keys never logged** — MD5 hash (first 10 chars) used in logs/Redis
- **Per-account scoring** — Keys can be invalidated without affecting others
- **Automatic rotation** — Cooldown on failed keys (5 min) then retry
- **No credentials in responses** — Only model/metrics returned to client

### ✅ Error Handling & Resilience

- **Graceful degradation**:
  - Redis unavailable → Use in-memory fallback (dev-safe)
  - Provider down → Try next provider
  - Key quota exceeded → Try next key
  - All options exhausted → Clear error message
- **Request validation** — Reject malformed requests with 400 Bad Request
- **Timeout protection** — HTTP timeouts per provider (30–90s)
- **Retry logic** — Automatic retries for transient failures

### ✅ Middleware & HTTP Features

- **CORS** — Permissive (all origins) for self-hosted deployment
- **Request timing** — `X-Response-Time-Ms` header on all responses
- **Structured errors** — JSON error responses matching OpenAI format
- **Optional gateway auth** — `Authorization: Bearer` header support

   - Key rotation per model (max account utilization)
   - Cross-vendor fallback (guaranteed success if any provider has quota)

3. **Semantic Caching** (vs. no caching)
   - 40–60% quota savings on deterministic requests (temp ≤ 0.3)
   - Instant responses for repeated requests
   - Transparent to caller

4. **Per-Key Tracking** (vs. per-provider)
   - Supports unlimited accounts per provider
   - Fine-grained quota visibility
   - Precise rate-limit enforcement

5. **In-Memory Fallback** (vs. hard dependency on Redis)
   - Works without external services in dev
   - Graceful degradation in production
   - Faster startup
