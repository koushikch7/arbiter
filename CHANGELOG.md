## [1.20.2] – 2026-06-02 — Smart Quota Management + Model Catalog Cleanup

### Fixed — Limit Management (`app/key_management/key_pool.py`, `app/routing/router.py`)

- **Daily-exhaustion 429 now sets until-midnight cooldown** — previously a Cloudflare "neurons exhausted" 429 set only a 62-second cooldown, causing the key to be retried every minute all day and generating thousands of wasted requests. Now any 429 containing "neuron", "daily free allocation", "daily limit", or "daily quota" calls `mark_daily_exhausted()` which sets the daily Redis counter to `daily_limit+1` with a TTL expiring 10 minutes after midnight UTC — the key is effectively invisible to the scorer until the quota resets.
- **Provider fast-skip when daily quota exhausted** — after the first model from a provider returns `key=None`, Arbiter checks `is_daily_exhausted()`. If all keys for that provider are out of budget, all remaining models from that provider are skipped immediately (O(1) per skip vs O(Redis reads × models) before). Eliminates 10–15 wasted routing iterations per request when Cloudflare's daily neurons are spent.
- **New `KeyPool` methods** — `mark_daily_exhausted(key)` and `is_daily_exhausted(model=None)` added to the public interface; both are safe to call from concurrent routing tasks.

### Fixed — Model Catalog (`app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py`)

- Removed `@cf/moonshot/kimi-k2.6` and `@cf/moonshot/kimi-k2.5` — Cloudflare never shipped these models; every attempt returned HTTP 400 "No such model", poisoning Cloudflare's error rate counter.
- Removed `ollama/deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud` — requires an Ollama Plus subscription; always returned HTTP 403, pushing Ollama into Gap-A demotion.
- Removed `gemini/gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` — model was discontinued 2026-05-25; returning errors continuously.
- Fixed `cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507` → `qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct` (Cerebras API does not accept date suffixes).

### Fixed — Cloudflare Quota (`app/key_management/key_pool.py`)

- Cloudflare provider `daily` limit corrected from 1,000 → 200 calls (10,000 neurons ÷ ~50 avg/call). Added per-model overrides: 8B models → 400/day, 20B → 300/day, 70B → 150/day, 120B → 80/day.

### Fixed — Model Auto-Disable (`app/routing/router.py`, `app/services/model_health.py`)

- Permanent errors (HTTP 404 "not found", 403 "forbidden/no access") now automatically write `arbiter:disabled:model:{provider}:{model}` to Redis with 7-day TTL.
- Router checks this set (60s cache) and removes permanently-disabled models from the candidate chain before routing begins.
- Weekly health probe clears the disabled flag when a model recovers; sets it on permanent failure.

### No API changes

- `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` request/response formats are unchanged. All client applications using Arbiter are unaffected.

---

## [1.20.1] – 2026-05-27 — Enterprise UI + Analytics Hardening + OpenAPI Parity

### Added — OpenAPI / Swagger / ReDoc Parity (`app/models/schemas.py`, `app/api/chat.py`)

- **`ChatTool` schema published** in OpenAPI — `tools` field on `ChatCompletionRequest` is now formally declared (was previously hidden behind `extra="allow"`). SDK code generators now see it.
- Added formal `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `response_format` fields.
- `metadata` description expanded to enumerate every recognized key including v1.20 additions: `realtime`, `web_search`, `google_search`.
- `/v1/chat/completions` docstring rewritten as a Markdown reference table with v1.20 headers (`X-Arbiter-Realtime`, `X-Arbiter-Complexity`, `X-Arbiter-Realtime-Sources`) and Tavily/grounding sections.

### Added — Auto-generated Developer Endpoint Table (`static/developer.html`)

- Hand-maintained API endpoint table replaced with client-side fetch from `/openapi.json`. The Developer page now reflects whatever Swagger reflects — no drift possible.
- Filter input + tag dropdown + endpoint count surfaces all 87 operations across 17 tags.

### Added — Analytics Enhancements (`app/api/analytics_api.py`, `static/analytics.html`)

- **Percentile latency tracking** — new Redis sorted-set per provider (`arbiter:stats:lat_samples:*`) holding the last 1 000 observations. `obs_stats.get_latency_percentiles()` computes p50/p95/p99 on demand. Surfaced as 3 KPI cards on Analytics.
- **Error-type breakdown KPI** — splits 24h errors into rate-limited (429) vs upstream provider errors, with per-provider drilldown.
- **Cost / quota ledger** — `_cost_ledger()` aggregates the last 7 daily buckets plus month-to-date plus linear month-end projection. Rendered as 6-cell KPI + 7-day sparkline.
- **Per-key health table** — `_per_key_gauges()` exposes live `KeyPool.get_stats()` per provider with RPM/TPM/daily progress bars (color-graded 60/85%) and tier badges.
- **Date presets** — Today / Yesterday / Week / Month / Year buttons added alongside the existing 1h/4h/24h/7d/30d window presets.
- **Compare mode toggle** — UI button wired; full overlay implementation in next pass.
- **CSV / JSON export** — every analytics table gets a download helper (`exportTable()`); column headers preserved.
- **Page Visibility guardrail** — auto-refresh suspends when the tab is hidden (saves 10–15 req/min per idle browser tab).
- **Anomaly bell** — rolling z-score on RPM. >2.5σ spike or drop surfaces as a topbar bell with title tooltip showing baseline + z.

### Added — Persistent Log & Audit Viewer (`static/logs-persistent.html`, `app/main.py`)

- New `/logs/persistent` page with 4 tabs: **API Calls** (180-day request log), **Admin Activity** (HMAC-signed audit), **Errors** (provider + UI errors), **Summary** (per-day stats).
- Filter by date range + free-text search; export current view as JSON.
- Wraps the existing `/api/logs/persistent/*` endpoints — no backend changes required.

### Added — Frontend Error Reporter (`app/api/ui_errors_api.py`, `static/analytics.html`)

- New `POST /api/ui-error` endpoint (public, IP-rate-limited to 1/2s) accepts JS runtime errors and unhandled promise rejections from the frontend.
- JS shim added: `window.onerror` + `unhandledrejection` → POST → appended to the daily errors JSONL file (180-day retention).
- New `persistent_log.write_error()` helper used by both the existing provider-error path and the new UI ingest.

### Added — Accessibility Pass (WCAG 2.1 AA basics) (`static/arbiter.css`, all `static/*.html`)

- Skip-link added to every page (`<a href="#main" class="skip-link">` becomes focusable from the keyboard).
- `role="main"` on `<main>`, `role="banner"` on topbar, `role="navigation" aria-label="Primary"` on sidebar.
- `id="main"` on the main content landmark on every page for the skip-link target.
- Universal `:focus-visible` ring (`outline: 2px solid var(--accent-br)`).
- `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` disables animations for users with vestibular sensitivities.
- New `.sr-only` utility for screen-reader-only labels.
- `aria-label` filled in on icon-only buttons across analytics and persistent-log pages.

### Smoke-tested (live 2026-05-27)

- `GET /openapi.json` now lists `X-Arbiter-Realtime`, `X-Arbiter-Complexity`, `x_arbiter`, `Tavily`, plus the `ChatTool` schema and `tools` field on `ChatCompletionRequest`. ✓
- `POST /api/ui-error` returns `{"ok": true}` unauthenticated, records to `data/logs/errors/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. ✓
- `/v1/chat/completions` (TRIVIAL prompt) routes to `groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant` with `x_arbiter` block in body and v1.20 headers. ✓
- `/logs/persistent` page renders the 4 tabs and loads /api/logs/persistent/api/activity/errors/summary. ✓

---

## [1.20.0] – 2026-05-26 — Real-Time Web Search + Multi-Key Hardening + Verified Free-Tier Limits

### Added — Real-Time Web Search via Tavily (`app/services/web_search.py`)

- **New module** wrapping `https://api.tavily.com/search` with async httpx, redis-backed 5-min cache, 8 s timeout, structured response object with `as_context_block()` rendering numbered citations.
- **Opt-in via header** `X-Arbiter-Realtime: true` (or `metadata.realtime` in the body). When set:
  1. Last user message is extracted as the search query.
  2. Tavily is called (top 5 results + AI-generated answer summary).
  3. Results are prepended to the request as a fresh `system` message with citation markers.
  4. The chosen LLM answers grounded in those sources.
- **Source URLs surfaced** via response header `X-Arbiter-Realtime-Sources` and body field `x_arbiter.realtime_sources`.
- **Auto-detect helper** `looks_time_sensitive()` returns true for keywords like *today, current, latest, price, news, weather, score*. Not auto-invoked — clients explicitly enable.
- Configured via env var `TAVILY_API_KEY` (free tier: 1 000 searches/month).

### Added — Gemini Native Google Search Grounding (`app/providers/gemini.py`)

- Provider now forwards `{"tools":[{"google_search":{}}]}` to Gemini when the request includes a `tools` entry of type `google_search` / `google_search_retrieval`, or when `metadata.realtime` / `metadata.web_search` / `metadata.google_search` is true.
- Free on Gemini 2.0+ and 3.x.

### Added — OpenRouter `:online` Opt-In (`app/api/chat.py`)

- When `X-Arbiter-Realtime: true` is set AND an OpenRouter-style `vendor/model` was pinned, the router appends `:online` so OpenRouters Brave-backed web plugin kicks in.
- Opt-in only — never auto-applied to avoid surprise per-search charges.

### Added — Client Observability (`app/api/chat.py`)

- **JSON response body now echoes the chosen model** into the OpenAI-format `model` field instead of `auto` or the users pin.
- **New `x_arbiter` block** in the body: `{"provider":..., "model":..., "complexity":..., "realtime_sources":[...]}` for SDKs that dont read custom headers.
- **New response header `X-Arbiter-Complexity`**: `TRIVIAL` | `SIMPLE` | `MODERATE` | `COMPLEX` | `EXPERT`.

### Fixed — Multi-Key Rotation Correctness (`app/key_management/key_pool.py`)

- **Sliding-window TTL refresh bug**: `record_usage()` was running `INCR; EXPIRE 60` on every call, refreshing the TTL each time so a continuously-used keys RPM counter would accumulate monotonically until the very first 60 s gap. Now uses `SET key 0 EX 60 NX; INCRBY key by` — the TTL anchors to the *first* increment in the window.
- **Daily counter date-bucketed**: replaced 86 400 s sliding TTL with `{provider}:{key_hash}:daily:YYYY-MM-DD` (30 h safety TTL). Now auto-rolls at UTC 00:00 regardless of traffic pattern (matches Googles reset semantics).
- **Per-model rate limits**: new `MODEL_OVERRIDES` dict + `get_model_limits()` helper. `get_best_key()` / `record_usage()` / `_score_key()` accept optional `model=`. Effective ceiling = `max(provider_aggregate_used, per_model_used)` versus per-model limit — flash-lite gets 1 000 RPD on the same key that pro is capped at 100 RPD on; llama-3.1-8b-instant gets 14 400 RPD instead of being bottlenecked by 70bs 1 000 RPD.
- **`get_stats()` exposes per-key tier** (`free` / `paid`) for the analytics dashboard.

### Fixed — Verified-Against-Docs Free-Tier Limits (`app/key_management/key_pool.py`)

All `PROVIDER_LIMITS` values cross-checked against official provider documentation on 2026-05-26:

| Provider | Old | New (verified) |
|---|---|---|
| Gemini | 5/250K/100 (pro bottleneck) | 15/250K/1 000 (flash-lite default) |
| Groq | 30/6 K/1 000 | 30/6 K/14 400 (8b-instant default) |
| Cerebras | 30/60 K/1 M tokens | 5/30 K/1 000 (tightened per docs) |
| Cloudflare | 300/1 M/10 000 | 300/1 M/1 000 (chat-call equivalent) |
| HuggingFace | 10/50 K/500 | 10/50 K/100 ($0.10 monthly credit) |
| Pollinations | 5/100 K/1 000 | 4/100 K/1 000 (1 req / 15 s) |

NVIDIA, OpenRouter, Cohere, Routeway, Z.ai unchanged. New `ollama` entry: 60 / 500 K / 5 000.

### Fixed — Dead Gemini Pre-GA Bridge (`app/providers/gemini.py`)

- Removed `_PRERELEASE_BRIDGE = {"gemini-3.1-flash-lite": "gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview"}` mapping. Google retired the preview endpoint on 2026-05-25; the GA endpoint is now live everywhere. Every free-Gemini call had been failing with 404 since the retirement.

### Fixed — `RateLimitError` Cooldown Wastes Capacity

- **`RateLimitError` now carries `retry_after` seconds** (`app/providers/base.py`). New `parse_retry_after()` helper extracts it from `Retry-After` headers (RFC 7231 — seconds or HTTP-date) and from common body patterns (`try again in X.Xs`, `reset after Xms`).
- Wired through all 13 providers (`gemini`, `groq`, `cerebras`, `cloudflare`, `openrouter`, `cohere`, `huggingface`, `pollinations`, `zai`, `routeway`, `ollama`, `nvidia`, `generic_openai`).
- Router uses `mark_failed(key, cooldown_seconds=retry_after + 2)` so a key that 429d with a 5 s wait is back in rotation in 7 s, not 5 minutes.

### Fixed — Tightened Diversity Bonus (`app/routing/auto_router.py`)

- Provider-diversity bonus (max 15) now only applies when the candidate model meets the minimum quality tier required by the request complexity. On EXPERT requests, diversity cannot pull a 7B model above a 120B flagship.

### Fixed — `nvidia` Missing From Key-Tier Map (`app/config.py`)

- `get_key_tiers()` mapping was missing `nvidia`. Adding `#paid` to an NVIDIA key now correctly tags it as paid tier.

### Smoke Tests (2026-05-26, live oracle.chkoushik.com)

| Test | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TRIVIAL `hi` | groq/llama-3.1-8b-instant in 392 ms | fast small model picked |
| Realtime BTC price | nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b in 7.5 s | Tavily injected 5 sources, answer cites [1]–[5] |
| EXPERT CAP/Raft prompt | cloudflare/@cf/openai/gpt-oss-120b in 4 s | flagship picked; diversity bonus didnt pull weaker model |
| Direct `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | success | was 100% 404 before |

## [1.19.3] – 2026-05-25 — Real-Time Analytics Enhancements & Cloudflare Fix

### Fixed — Cloudflare Provider Null Content Crash (`app/providers/cloudflare.py`)

- **Cloudflare responses with `null` message content (some streaming/tool-call paths) no longer crash with Pydantic `ValidationError`** ("Input should be a valid string, input_value=None"). The provider now coerces `None` → empty string before constructing the `Message` model. This was silently dropping otherwise-valid CF responses and forcing fallbacks.

### Added — In-Flight Request Gauge (`app/observability/stats.py`, `app/api/chat.py`)

- **Live concurrency counter** — atomic Redis `INCR`/`DECR` around every chat request (CF Worker branch, streaming generator, main non-streaming branch). Clamped to ≥0 to recover from crashes. Exposed as `summary.inflight` in `/analytics/data`.

### Added — Per-Minute Granularity History (`app/observability/stats.py`)

- **New `arbiter:stats:minute:{epoch_minute}:{requests,success,errors,tokens}` buckets** with 3h TTL. Written on every `record_success`, `record_request_failed`, and `record_cache_hit`. Surfaced via `get_minute_history(minutes=60)`.
- The analytics `1h` window now renders **60 one-minute buckets** instead of 12 five-minute buckets — true minute-by-minute visibility for high-traffic chat sessions.

### Added — Rolling Rate Calculators (`app/observability/stats.py`)

- **`get_rolling_rates(window_seconds)`** computes RPM, TPM, and error counts over arbitrary trailing windows. Analytics exposes 1m / 5m / 15m rolling windows.

### Added — Recent Activity Feed (`app/observability/stats.py`, `app/api/analytics_api.py`)

- **Redis sorted-set `arbiter:stats:recent_activity_z`** (4h TTL, sliding window capped at 100 entries) records the 30 most recent requests with `{ts, status, provider, model, tokens, latency_ms, token_label, error}`. Implemented with the same `zadd` + `zremrangebyscore` + `zremrangebyrank` pattern as the error feed.

### Added — Live Analytics UI Row (`static/analytics.html`)

- **4 new real-time cards above the KPI grid:** In-Flight Now, RPM (1 min), RPM (5 min), RPM (15 min) — each with a contextual sub-label (tokens/min or error count).
- **Live Activity Feed table** — Time / Status / Provider / Model / Tokens / Latency / Token, with color-coded status badges (green=success, indigo=cache_hit, red=error).
- **Dynamic history badge** — reflects current window granularity ("1-min buckets · last 1 h", "5-min buckets · last 4 h", etc.).
- **Responsive grid** — live row collapses to 2 columns ≤900px and 1 column ≤520px.

---

## [1.19.2] – 2026-05-24 — Real-Time Analytics & Filter Persistence

### Fixed — Analytics Caching (`app/api/analytics_api.py`)

- **`/analytics/data` endpoint now returns proper no-cache headers** (`Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate`, `Pragma: no-cache`, `CDN-Cache-Control: no-store`). Previously only the HTML page had no-cache headers — the JSON data API was missing them, causing browsers and CDNs to serve stale cached responses.
- Added `server_ts` field to response payload for client-side freshness verification.

### Improved — Real-Time Updates (`static/analytics.html`)

- **Default refresh interval changed from 30s → 5s** for true real-time monitoring.
- **Added `cache: 'no-store'` to fetch() calls** — forces the browser to bypass its HTTP cache entirely.
- **Added cache-busting `_t` query parameter** to every request — prevents any intermediate proxy/CDN caching.
- **Added fetch deduplication** — overlapping requests are prevented if the previous one is still in-flight.
- **Timestamps now show seconds** in the "Updated" indicator for better visibility of freshness.

### Added — Filter Persistence (`static/analytics.html`)

- **All filter selections are now persisted to localStorage** — window preset, date range, token, provider, and model selections survive page refresh and browser restart.
- **Refresh interval is persisted to localStorage** — user's preferred polling speed is remembered across sessions.
- **Filter values are re-applied after dynamic dropdown population** — on first data load, select dropdowns are populated from the server, then persisted selections are correctly restored even though options weren't available at page load.

---

## [1.19.1] – 2026-05-24 — Tool-Calling Routing & Provider Fix

### Fixed — Tool-Call Aware Routing (`app/routing/router.py`)

- **Requests containing `tools` or `functions` fields are now automatically routed only to providers that support tool calling** (groq, nvidia, openrouter, cerebras, ollama). Previously, tool-call requests could be sent to providers like Cloudflare Workers AI or HuggingFace that silently ignore tools, resulting in empty/meaningless responses.
- Falls back to all providers with a warning if no tool-capable provider is available.

### Fixed — Tool Forwarding in Providers

- **OpenRouter** (`app/providers/openrouter.py`): Now forwards `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`, and `response_format` fields to the upstream API (both `complete()` and `complete_stream()`).
- **Cerebras** (`app/providers/cerebras.py`): Same tool-forwarding fields added to both paths.
- **Ollama Cloud** (`app/providers/ollama_provider.py`): Same tool-forwarding fields added to both paths.
- **Groq** and **NVIDIA** already had full tool forwarding — no changes needed.

### Changed — Pollinations API Key

- Replaced exhausted Pollinations key (`pk_pbk2w5a...`, budget=0) with new active key. Fixes persistent 402 errors and wasted fallback latency on every request that attempted Pollinations.

---

## [1.19.0] – 2026-05-23 — Intelligent Complexity-Aware Routing

### Added — Complexity Analyzer (`app/routing/complexity_analyzer.py`)

- New module that analyses request content to determine complexity tier:
  - **TRIVIAL** — greetings, yes/no, one-word answers (→ fast/small models)
  - **SIMPLE** — short factual Q&A, quick translations
  - **MODERATE** — multi-step instructions, moderate code, explanations
  - **COMPLEX** — deep reasoning, large code generation, creative long-form
  - **EXPERT** — multi-domain expert analysis, research-level problems, advanced architectures
- Scoring based on 13 factors: message length, conversation depth, system prompt sophistication, task complexity markers, expert-level indicators, code complexity, multi-component signals, reasoning depth, quality signals, code blocks, list items, intent classification, and numbered requirements.

### Changed — Smart Auto-Router (`app/routing/auto_router.py`)

- **Complexity-aware scoring**: Models are now scored based on how well their quality matches the request complexity. Expert requests strongly prefer quality-5 models; trivial requests prefer fast models.
- **Dynamic quality/speed weights**: Controlled by complexity tier instead of static values. TRIVIAL: speed_w=30/quality_w=8. EXPERT: quality_w=45/speed_w=5.
- **Quota-capacity bonus** (max 12): Models with generous RPD/RPM limits get a scoring boost (e.g., Cloudflare 300 RPM, Groq 14400 RPD → full bonus; Cohere 33 RPD → minimal bonus). Naturally steers traffic to high-capacity providers, preserving scarce quota for unique capabilities.
- **Provider diversity guarantee**: `_ensure_provider_diversity()` ensures top-8 candidates include 5+ different providers by interleaving under-represented providers.
- **Model-level load jitter**: Deterministic per-minute jitter (±6 points) now uses `provider:model:minute` hash, enabling both inter-provider and intra-provider rotation of same-quality models.
- **Complexity-triggered priority override**: COMPLEX/EXPERT requests with priority="balanced" auto-escalate to priority="quality".
- **Expanded INTENT_TAGS**: "creative" now includes "reasoning" fallback; "balanced" includes "reasoning" and "creative".

### Changed — Complexity Analyzer Improvements

- Added "design a ..." pattern to complex task markers (catches "design a distributed cache", "design a database schema", etc.)
- Added distributed systems terminology to expert markers: consistent hashing, replication, sharding, fault tolerance, circuit breaker, load balancing, CAP theorem, eventual/strong consistency, Raft, Paxos, CRDT, vector clocks.

### Changed — Smart Model Upgrade (Router)

- **Automatic model upgrade for explicit requests**: When a client explicitly requests a weak model (quality ≤ 2) but the request is MODERATE or higher complexity, the router transparently upgrades to capability-matched models while keeping the original as a fallback.
- This ensures clients with hardcoded model names (e.g., `llama3.1-8b`) still get high-quality responses for complex queries.

### Changed — Intent Classifier (`app/routing/intent_classifier.py`)

- Removed aggressive "fast" classification for short messages (< 30 chars no longer auto-classified as "fast"). Only explicit speed keywords trigger "fast" intent. This prevents real questions from being routed to the smallest models.

### Fixed — Performance Sort (`router.py::_sort_candidates_by_perf`)

- **Replaced disruptive full re-sort with demote-only logic**: The previous implementation grouped candidates by provider and re-sorted within groups by historical success rate, which completely overrode the auto-router's quality-based ordering. Now it only demotes models with ≥30% error rate to the tail, preserving the complexity-aware ordering for everything else.

### Fixed — Gap A Health Check (`router.py::_get_unhealthy_providers`)

- **Rate-limited responses no longer count as errors**: Previously, 429 rate-limit responses were included in the error count, causing providers with normal free-tier rate limiting (Cloudflare, Groq, HuggingFace, Pollinations) to be permanently marked unhealthy.
- **Raised thresholds**: 200 requests minimum (was 100), 30% error rate (was 20%).
- **Uses pipeline**: Single Redis round-trip for all provider stats.

### Performance Results (measured)

- **Provider distribution**: 9 different providers in top-8 routing chains (was 2)
- **Model diversity**: 21 unique models in routing candidates (was 2)
- **Expert requests**: 120B-671B models selected, 8K-40K char responses (was: 8B model, ~500 char responses)
- **Trivial requests**: 7-20B models, < 50 chars, < 500ms (efficient resource use)
- **Quota preservation**: High-capacity providers (Cloudflare 300 RPM, Cerebras, Groq 14.4K RPD) absorb bulk traffic; scarce-quota providers (Cohere, OpenRouter) reserved for unique capabilities
- **Zero compromise on quality**: Complex requests → flagship models (gpt-oss-120b, qwen-3-235b, deepseek-v3.1-671b, nemotron-3-super-120b)

## [1.18.1] – 2026-05-12 — Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite GA migration

### Breaking upstream change

- Google discontinued `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` effective **May 25, 2026** (email notification received May 12, 2026).
- Renamed model identifier to `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` (GA) across all runtime code:
  - `app/providers/gemini.py` — `default_model`, `models` list, module docstring.
  - `app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py` — `ModelSpec.id` updated.
  - `app/api/keys_api.py` — Gemini provider model list.
- Old preview identifier added to the "Deprecated / shut-down" section in `gemini.py`.
- No prompt or logic changes required (identical underlying model per Google's notice).

---

## [1.18.0] – 2026-05-20 — Persistent logs, activity audit, dashboard banners, adaptive routing

### 📁 Persistent 180-day file logs

- New module `app/observability/persistent_log.py` writes three JSONL streams under `/app/data/logs/` (mounted volume):
  - `api/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` — every gateway request (token, provider, latency, status, prompt/completion tokens, cached, client IP).
  - `activity/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` — every admin mutation (HMAC-tagged, secret-redacted, before/after snapshots).
  - `errors/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` — structured error records for trend analysis.
- 180-day retention enforced by a daily janitor task (03:00 UTC).
- Secret-shaped strings (`sk-…`, `AIza…`, `cfut_…`, etc.) are auto-redacted with a `head4…tail4 + sha256[:12]` fingerprint.
- `summarise(days=7)` aggregates by provider/token/error category for the weekly email.

### 🔒 Admin activity audit log

- All mutation endpoints now write an HMAC-tagged audit record:
  - `keys_api.py` — add/remove key, enable/disable provider.
  - `gateway_tokens_api.py` — create/delete/update/regenerate token.
  - `settings_api.py` — routing update/reset, cache clear.
  - `cloudflare_manager.py` — worker create/delete.
  - `announcements_api.py` — banner create/delete.
- Records include actor email (from SSO), role, action, target, before/after, request IP, and a SHA-256 HMAC tag keyed by `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`.

### 📢 Major-change dashboard banner

- New service `app/services/announcements.py` + API `app/api/announcements_api.py`.
- `POST /api/announcements` (admin only) — publishes a banner that stays live for 3 days (configurable 1–30).
- `GET /api/announcements/active` — read endpoint consumed by the dashboard component `static/components/announcements.js`.
- Banner lists *impacted gateways* — resolved on read from `arbiter:stats:token:*:provider:*:requests` so the data is always current.
- Severities: `info` / `warning` / `critical` with matching styling.
- Per-browser dismissal via localStorage; entries reappear on other browsers so notices aren't silently lost.

### ⚡ Adaptive routing (Gap A & B)

- **Gap A** — `app/routing/router.py` now demotes providers with lifetime error rate ≥ 20 % (≥100 requests) to the tail of the candidate chain. Computed once per minute, cached on the router instance.
- **Gap B** — `app/key_management/key_pool.py` now waits up to 10 s for the next minute boundary when *all* keys for a provider are predictively RPM-throttled, instead of hopping to the next provider. Prevents needless cross-provider fallbacks when the primary will be available imminently.
- **#9 TPM-aware scoring** — `get_best_key()` now accepts `estimated_request_tokens` so a key whose remaining TPM budget cannot serve the request is deprioritised. The router passes its existing token estimate for every call.

### 🚦 Per-token rate limiting (#12)

- `app/middleware/auth.py` enforces a sliding-minute-window rate limit on every `/v1/*` request after Bearer validation.
- Configurable globally via `GATEWAY_TOKEN_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MIN` (default 100). Per-token override via `request_limit_per_minute` on the token record; set to `0` to disable for an individual token.
- Returns 429 with `Retry-After` + `X-RateLimit-Limit` / `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.

### 📊 Consolidated weekly email + AI analysis

- The daily report (`app/services/daily_report.py`) now generates the *weekly* recap as an **additional section in the existing 22:00 IST email** on Mondays — no separate weekly email is sent.
- Weekly section includes 7-day API totals, p50/p95 latency, calls-by-provider, errors-by-category, admin-change count, and an AI-generated insights paragraph routed through Arbiter's own router.
- Error-rate alerts refined (#8): minimum sample size raised from 20 → 100 requests; rate-limited responses now excluded from the error count so 429 bursts don't trigger outage alerts.
- Rate-limit saturation alerts (#14): the report now flags providers where >50 % of weekly health probes were rate-limited.
- Secret-shaped strings (#11) are stripped from outbound HTML before send.

### 🩺 Health probe tagging (#14)

- `app/services/model_health.py` now records `rate_limited: true` as a separate field on probe results instead of folding it into the error message. Summary tracks `rate_limited` and `rate_limited_by_provider`.

### 🛠 Performance & hygiene (#15, #16)

- **Cache compression** — `app/cache/cache.py` now gzip+base64-compresses values ≥ 512 bytes (magic prefix `GZ1:`); legacy plain-JSON entries still read transparently.
- **Sorted-set error log** — `app/observability/stats.py::record_error_detail()` migrated from LPUSH+LTRIM (O(N) per write) to ZADD + ZREMRANGEBYSCORE (O(log N), score-based 48 h eviction). Reads fall back to the legacy list until those entries roll off.

## [1.17.0] – 2026-05-13 — NVIDIA-first routing, predictive rate limiting, weekly model health

### 🔥 Provider Cleanup — Modal & Lightning removed

- Removed the **Modal.com** and **Lightning.ai LitAI** providers from the platform. Both were unreliable / no longer aligned with the gateway's free-tier philosophy.
- Deleted files: `app/providers/modal_provider.py`, `app/providers/lightning_provider.py`, `app/api/modal_deploy.py`, `app/api/modal_manager.py`.
- Stripped from `app/main.py` (registration), `app/config.py` (settings), `app/providers/provider_registry.py`, `app/routing/router.py` (`_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER`), `app/api/keys_api.py`, `app/api/models_api.py`, `app/middleware/auth.py`, `app/api/custom_providers_api.py`, `app/streaming/openai_stream.py`, `app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py`, `app/key_management/key_pool.py`.
- Frontend: removed the entire **Modal GPU** tab from `static/settings.html` (~550 lines DOM+JS), Modal endpoint type from `static/playground.html`, `lightning`/`modal` colours from `static/analytics.html`, and `/modal/` from the service worker cache list.
- `.env` `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` commented out (preserved for forensics).
- Provider count: **14 → 12**.

### 🚀 NVIDIA prioritisation

- NVIDIA NIM moved to the **top** of `_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER` in `app/routing/router.py`:

  ```
  nvidia → gemini → groq → cerebras → zai → cloudflare → openrouter
         → cohere → huggingface → pollinations → ollama → routeway
  ```

  Highest-quality free-tier models (Llama 3.3 70B, Nemotron, DeepSeek R1) are now first-choice when their NVIDIA-hosted variant exists.

### 🛡️ Predictive rate limiting (avoids 429 backoff cycles)

- `app/key_management/key_pool.py::_score_key()` now treats any key whose **RPM or daily usage ≥ 95% of the provider limit** as ineligible (score = −1.0).
- The router transparently picks the next candidate **before** the upstream returns a 429 — eliminating the wait → 429 → backoff round-trip and reducing average request latency on saturated providers.
- New constant `_PREDICTIVE_THRESHOLD = 0.95` (tunable).

### 🩺 Weekly model health check

- New module **`app/services/model_health.py`** runs every **Monday 17:00 UTC (22:30 IST)** and probes every model on every configured provider with a 1-token `"Hi"` completion.
- Results stored at `arbiter:health:model:{provider}:{model}` (14-day TTL) with `{status, last_checked, error, latency_ms}`.
- Rate-limited probes are treated as healthy (not flagged).
- Scheduler wired into the app lifespan in `app/main.py` alongside the daily report.

### 📊 Daily report enhancements

- New **"High Error-Rate Providers"** banner — any provider with lifetime error rate ≥ 25% (min 20 requests) is surfaced in red so you can decide whether to keep or retire it.
- New **"Weekly Model Health Check"** section — lists every model that failed the latest probe with the upstream error message; summary count of working vs. failing.
- Both sections appear above the existing failure-analysis block in the daily email.

### 🌊 Native streaming for custom providers (Bug 3 fix)

- `app/providers/generic_openai.py::complete_stream()` added — user-added custom OpenAI-compatible providers now use the shared `stream_openai_chat()` helper instead of falling back to the router's faux-stream path.
- Anthropic-auth-scheme custom providers still fall back (their SSE format differs).

### 🧹 Misc

- `APP_VERSION` → `1.17.0` (`app/main.py`, `static/components/sidebar.js`).
- HuggingFace catalogue trimmed earlier in this session (3 stale models removed) is now considered part of the v1.17.0 cycle.

### 🔍 Post-release re-audit fixes (same cycle)

- **Predictive throttle tuned** — threshold lowered from 0.95 → **0.85** in `app/key_management/key_pool.py` so the gateway stops thrashing through the last 15% of every key's RPM/daily window when reset is imminent.
- **Weekly health check bounded concurrency** — `app/services/model_health.py` now uses `asyncio.Semaphore(4)` and `asyncio.gather()` so Monday's probe pass doesn't saturate every provider's RPM and trigger a 429 cascade on real user traffic.
- **SSRF guard on custom providers** — `_validate_base_url()` in `app/providers/generic_openai.py` rejects non-http(s) schemes, GCP/AWS metadata hostnames, and any host that resolves to a loopback/private/link-local IP. Stops admin-side social-engineering attacks that pivot through the gateway into internal networks.
- **Pooled httpx client for custom providers** — module-level `_HTTPX_CLIENT` with `Limits(max_connections=100, max_keepalive_connections=40)` reused across all `GenericOpenAIProvider` instances; closed cleanly on shutdown via `aclose_http_client()` registered in `app/main.py`. Eliminates per-request TCP-pool churn that previously could exhaust ephemeral ports under load.
- **Redis pipelining in router hot path** — `_get_disabled_providers()` and `_get_custom_config()` in `app/routing/router.py` now batch their `GET`s into a single `pipeline().execute()`, saving ~24 sequential round-trips per uncached lookup.



### 📝 Documentation

- **`static/developer.html`** — Endpoints tab now includes full SSE documentation:
  - Request parameters table (all fields including `stream`)
  - SSE event format with annotated example (`arbiter-model-used` comment, heartbeat keepalives, delta chunks, final chunk with usage, `[DONE]`)
  - Streaming caveats (caching semantics, fallback behaviour, `cfworker/*` exclusion)
  - SDK streaming examples added to the SDKs tab: Python `openai`, JS `openai`, raw `curl`, LangChain `streaming=True`

- **`USERGUIDE.md`**:
  - `stream` parameter row updated: was "not yet supported", now "Enable SSE streaming — see Streaming section"
  - New **Streaming** section added after the `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint docs — covers curl, Python SDK, JS SDK, SSE event format table, caching, and fallback semantics

- **`README.md`**:
  - `stream` parameter bullet updated: was "**Not yet supported**", now links to Streaming section
  - New **Streaming** section added with curl quick-start, SDK note, and link to full USERGUIDE docs

### ✨ Playground

- **Stream toggle** added to the Parameters card (`stream-toggle` checkbox)
  - When checked, gateway requests (`/v1/chat/completions`) are sent with `stream: true`
  - Response is consumed via `ReadableStream` / `getReader()` — text tokens appear progressively in the chat bubble as they arrive
  - `cfworker/*` endpoints: toggle is silently ignored (non-streaming always used, matching API behaviour)
  - Modal direct-endpoint calls: non-streaming (Modal endpoints may not expose SSE)
  - Duplicate message prevention: streamed messages are pushed to `_messages` inline; the outer handler skips the push on return (`_streamed` flag)

---

## [1.16.2] – 2026-05-12 — SSE Phase 3: native streaming for all 14 providers

### ✨ New features

- **Native SSE streaming for the remaining 6 OpenAI-compatible providers** via the shared `stream_openai_chat()` helper:
  - `pollinations`, `routeway`, `ollama_provider`, `zai_provider`, `lightning_provider`, `modal_provider`
  - Each provider's `complete_stream()` mirrors its `complete()` payload exactly (model resolution, headers, auth split for Modal `endpoint_url|token`, optional `Bearer` for Pollinations free tier, etc).
  - Routeway adds `stream_options.include_usage` for real token counts in the final chunk.

- **Format translators for the 2 non-OpenAI providers** (true native SSE, not faux):
  - **`GeminiProvider.complete_stream()`** — calls `streamGenerateContent?alt=sse`, parses Google's JSON chunks (`candidates[0].content.parts[*].text`, `finishReason`, `usageMetadata`), and emits OpenAI-shape `chat.completion.chunk` events with `delta.role` → `delta.content` → final `finish_reason` + `usage`.
  - **`CohereProvider.complete_stream()`** — calls Cohere v2 `/chat` with `stream: true`, handles the typed event stream (`message-start`, `content-delta`, `message-end`) and translates `delta.message.content.text` → OpenAI `delta.content`, plus `usage.billed_units.{input,output}_tokens` → OpenAI `usage.{prompt,completion}_tokens`.

### 📊 Coverage matrix (now complete)

| Provider | Native SSE | Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| cerebras, cloudflare, groq, huggingface, nvidia, openrouter | ✅ (Phase 2) | OpenAI passthrough via `stream_openai_chat()` |
| pollinations, routeway, ollama, zai, lightning, modal | ✅ (Phase 3) | OpenAI passthrough via `stream_openai_chat()` |
| gemini | ✅ (Phase 3) | Google `streamGenerateContent` → OpenAI translator |
| cohere | ✅ (Phase 3) | Cohere v2 typed events → OpenAI translator |

**14 / 14 providers** now stream natively with true low TTFT. The v1.16.0 faux-stream fallback path is retained as a safety net for any provider that raises pre-first-chunk (network errors, future provider additions, etc).

### 🔧 Internal

- `BaseProvider.complete_stream()` is no longer reachable for the shipped providers — every provider in production overrides it.
- Verified live: `✓ [stream-native] gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite tokens=19 latency=4589ms` and `✓ [stream-native] cohere/command-r-plus-08-2024 tokens=7 latency=1015ms`.
- **APP_VERSION** bumped to `1.16.2`. Sidebar version label updated.

## [1.16.1] – 2026-05-12 — SSE Phase 2: native per-provider streaming

### ✨ New features

- **Native SSE streaming** for 6 OpenAI-compatible providers (true low-TTFT, no chunked replay):
  - `cerebras`, `cloudflare`, `groq_provider`, `huggingface`, `nvidia_provider`, `openrouter`
  - Each provider now exposes `complete_stream()` that POSTs with `"stream": true` and yields chunks as the upstream emits them via the new shared helper `app/streaming/openai_stream.py::stream_openai_chat()` (`httpx.AsyncClient.stream()` + `aiter_lines()` SSE parser).
  - Groq + OpenRouter add `stream_options.include_usage` so the final chunk carries real token counts (no estimation needed for stats / cache).
  - **Backward compatible**: providers without `complete_stream()` (Gemini, Cohere, Pollinations, Routeway, Ollama, Z.ai, Lightning, Modal) cleanly raise `NotImplementedError` and the router transparently falls back to v1.16.0's faux-stream path.

### 🔀 Router changes

- `Router.route_stream()` now tries native streaming first per (provider, model) attempt. Behavior:
  - **First chunk reached** → commit to native; emit each chunk as `data: {...}` immediately, accumulate text+usage on the side for cache + stats, finish with `data: [DONE]`.
  - **Pre-first-chunk failure** (`NotImplementedError`, `RateLimitError`, `ProviderError`, network) → fall back to faux-stream via `complete()` (existing v1.16.0 behavior — same fallback semantics, same heartbeats).
  - **Mid-stream failure** (after first chunk sent) → emit OpenAI-style `data: {"error":...}` event + `[DONE]` and stop. Cannot fall back transparently because bytes already left the gateway (matches OpenAI's own SSE behavior).
- Native success path **reconstructs a synthetic `ChatCompletionResponse`** from accumulated text + final usage chunk and writes it to the cache (only for `temperature ≤ 0.3`), so a subsequent identical call still gets an instant cached replay.
- Heartbeats (`: thinking / evaluating / generating / almost there`) still emit while waiting for the first native chunk, keeping nginx/Cloudflare connections warm.

### 🔧 Internal

- New `app/streaming/openai_stream.py` (~135 LOC) — shared SSE parser + chunk extractor utilities (`extract_delta_content`, `extract_finish_reason`, `extract_usage`).
- `BaseProvider.complete_stream()` is now an async generator stub that raises `NotImplementedError` on first iteration (cleaner than a coroutine that raises before iteration).
- **APP_VERSION** bumped to `1.16.1`. Sidebar version label updated.

### 📝 Notes
- Verified live with NVIDIA: `✓ [stream-native] nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b tokens=70 latency=1015ms` — chunks arrived incrementally with real per-token deltas, including NVIDIA-specific `reasoning` field (forwarded verbatim).
- Phase 3 (future, optional): add native streaming to Pollinations / Routeway / Ollama / Z.ai / Lightning / Modal (mechanical — same shared helper). Gemini + Cohere need format translators since they don't speak OpenAI SSE natively.

---

## [1.16.0] – 2026-05-10 — SSE Streaming + Phase 7 audit fixes

### ✨ New features

- **OpenAI-compatible SSE streaming** (`stream: true`) — `POST /v1/chat/completions` now supports Server-Sent Events for **all 14 providers**.
  - **Architecture**: new `app/streaming/sse.py` module with chunk envelopes, heartbeat helpers, and a faux-stream replayer; new `Router.route_stream()` async generator mirroring `Router.route()` (same routing/fallback/key-rotation/caching logic).
  - **"Graceful streaming" Phase 1 strategy**: every provider works immediately because `route_stream()` calls the existing `provider.complete()`, emits `: thinking / evaluating / generating / almost there` SSE comment heartbeats every 5 s while waiting (keeps nginx/Cloudflare from idle-killing the connection), then replays the response as `chat.completion.chunk` deltas in word-bursts terminated by `data: [DONE]`. TTFT is unchanged from non-streaming, but the UX, OpenAI-SDK compatibility, and infra-friendliness are full. Native per-provider SSE for true low TTFT will land in Phase 2.
  - **Cache hits replay as a stream** (in milliseconds) using the same chunk path. The `_arbiter_provider/_arbiter_model` is surfaced via an SSE comment (`: arbiter-model-used: gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`).
  - **Provider failures fall back transparently** as long as no chunks have been sent yet (matches OpenAI's own SSE behavior). Mid-stream failures emit an OpenAI-style error event and `[DONE]`.
  - **Refactor**: extracted `Router._prepare_route()` shared helper used by both `route()` and `route_stream()` — eliminates ~90 LOC of duplication.
  - **Headers set**: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`, `Connection: keep-alive`, `X-Accel-Buffering: no` (nginx/CF will not buffer chunks).
  - **`cfworker/*` direct-proxy routes** explicitly reject `stream=true` with HTTP 400 (proxied workers are not SSE-aware in this build).

### 🐛 Fixed (Phase 7 audit)

- **Cloudflare endpoints 500 errors** — `app/api/cloudflare_manager.py` was importing the removed helper `_merged_keys` from `keys_api`. Replaced both call sites with the current `_read_env_keys("cloudflare")` (sync, no redis arg). `GET /cloudflare/workers` now returns 401 (auth) instead of 500 (ImportError).
- **Dashboard accordion collapses on auto-refresh** — `static/dashboard.html` rebuilt the key-details accordion from scratch every 10 s, wiping any provider the user had expanded. Now snapshots the open `data-provider` set before re-render and re-applies `.open` to body + arrow afterwards. Also skips refresh when the tab is hidden (`document.hidden`).
- **Analytics filters single-shot population** — `static/analytics.html` only populated the token / provider / model dropdowns once via a `_filtersPopulated` flag, so newly-seen entries never appeared and switching pages mid-session left the dropdowns stale. Replaced with a `_syncSelect()` helper that adds/removes options on every refresh **while preserving the user's current selection**.

### 📝 Notes
- **Cache** — `app/cache/cache.py` is correctly used: it caches only deterministic requests (`temperature ≤ 0.3`) keyed by `(model, messages, max_tokens, stop, top_p)` with a default 1-hour TTL. Low cache-hit ratios in production are expected because most chat traffic uses higher temperatures. With streaming, cache hits now replay as SSE chunks too.
- **APP_VERSION** bumped to `1.16.0`. Sidebar version label updated.

## [1.15.0] – 2026-05-03 — SSOT Registry, Daily Reports, Gateway Routing Policies

### ✨ New features

- **SSOT Provider Registry** (`app/providers/provider_registry.py`) — Single
  source of truth for all 13 provider specs: `ProviderSpec`, `ModelSpec`,
  `ProviderLimits` dataclasses. Functions: `get_provider()`, `get_limits()`,
  `get_models()`, `provider_meta_for_api()`, `get_all_active_models()`. New API
  endpoint `GET /api/providers/meta` returns full provider metadata + active model list.

- **Daily Analytics Email** (`app/services/daily_report.py`) — Automated daily
  report sent at 06:00 UTC via SMTP (Zoho). Includes:
  - KPI summary (requests, success rate, cache hit rate)
  - Top 5 models and top 5 gateway tokens by usage
  - Provider health table
  - AI-classified error analysis (temporary/critical/warning)
  - Scheduler starts on app lifespan, stops on shutdown.

- **Email Service** (`app/services/email_service.py`) — Async SMTP sender using
  thread pool for non-blocking sends. Methods: `send()`, `send_to_admin()`,
  `send_invite()`. Configured via `SMTP_*` env vars.

- **Gateway Routing Policies** — Per-token model routing controls:
  - `auto` (default): unchanged smart routing behavior
  - `restricted`: token can ONLY use models in its `allowed_models` list
  - `preferred`: `allowed_models` are tried first, then auto fallback
  - `blocked_models`: always excluded regardless of policy
  - Backend: `gateway_tokens_api.py` (create/update bodies), `auth.py` middleware
    (attaches policy to request.state), `router.py` (applies filter after perf sort)
  - UI: Settings → Gateway Keys tab now shows Policy column in token table,
    Create Token form has routing policy dropdown + model picker + blocked models input.

- **Developer Documentation Page** (`static/developer.html`) — Replaces
  `/api-docs`. 6-tab layout: Quick Start, Authentication, Endpoints, Routing,
  SDK Examples, Gateway Tokens. Code examples for Python, JS/TS, LangChain,
  LiteLLM, cURL. `/api-docs` redirects to `/developer`.

- **User Email Invite** (`app/api/users_api.py`) — `POST /api/users/invite`
  pre-approves a user and sends an HTML invitation email via the email service.
  UI: Users page has "Invite via Email" card.

- **Sidebar Updates** (`static/components/sidebar.js`) — Version `v1.15.0`;
  "Developer Docs" nav item replacing "API Docs"; "Users & Access" under new
  "Administration" section; free-tier warning div in sidebar footer.

### 🔧 Changes

- **Session TTL** — Extended from 24 hours to 5 days (`SESSION_MAX_AGE=432000`)
  to prevent PWA logout on mobile devices.
- **Backup Pagination** (`static/backup.html`) — Fixed infinite-row rendering.
  Now paginated at 20 items/page with prev/next navigation.
- **Config** (`app/config.py`) — Added SMTP settings (`SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`,
  `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, `SMTP_FROM`, `SMTP_FROM_NAME`, `SMTP_TO`,
  `DAILY_REPORT_HOUR`).
- **APP_VERSION** bumped to `1.15.0`.

---

## [1.14.3] – 2026-05-03 — NVIDIA NIM provider + Playground fixes

### ✨ New features

- **NVIDIA NIM provider** (`app/providers/nvidia_provider.py`) — 13th provider
  added. OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `integrate.api.nvidia.com`. Free tier:
  40 RPM, 1000 RPD, 131K context window.
  - 5 verified reliable models: `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b` (120B MoE,
    flagship), `meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct`, `mistralai/mistral-medium-3.5-128b`,
    `mistralai/mistral-small-4-119b-2603`, `google/gemma-3-27b-it`.
  - Auto-discovery: `fetch_models()` returns 140+ models from NVIDIA's catalog.
  - Integrated into free-tier catalog, router fallback chain (position 4 after
    cerebras), PROVIDER_LIMITS, Settings UI (color #76b900), and Playground.
  - Key format: `nvapi-...` from https://build.nvidia.com.
- **Playground SSO fallback** (`app/middleware/auth.py`) — `/v1/*` routes now
  accept a valid Google SSO session as fallback when no Bearer token is present.
  This allows the built-in Playground (same-origin, session-authenticated) to
  call the completions API without requiring a separate gateway token.

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Playground `[object Object]` error** (`static/playground.html`) — Error
  parser now correctly extracts `error.message` from OpenAI-format error
  responses instead of coercing the error object to string. Also handles
  non-JSON responses (Cloudflare HTML 502 pages) gracefully with HTML tag
  stripping.
- **Playground content normalization** — `_extractContent()` helper handles
  content returned as string, array of blocks, or object (covers all provider
  quirks). `marked.parse()` no longer receives null/undefined.
- **NVIDIA empty extras** (`app/providers/nvidia_provider.py`) — Empty
  `tool_calls: []`, null `refusal`, etc. from NVIDIA responses are no longer
  serialized into the output. Keeps response JSON minimal and avoids confusing
  downstream parsers.
- **Provider timeout** — Reduced from 60s to 45s with explicit
  `TimeoutException` handler that returns a descriptive error message
  ("model may be overloaded or unavailable") instead of generic network error.

### 📝 Configuration

- `app/config.py` — Added `NVIDIA_API_KEYS` field to Settings model.
- `app/key_management/key_pool.py` — Added NVIDIA to `PROVIDER_LIMITS`
  (40 RPM, 500K TPM, 1000 RPD).
- `app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py` — Added 5 NVIDIA ModelSpec entries.
- `app/api/keys_api.py` — Added NVIDIA to `_ENV_VAR_MAP` and `_PROVIDER_META`.
- `app/api/models_api.py` — Added "nvidia" to `_FREE_TIER_PROVIDERS` and
  `_VENDOR_LABELS`.
- `app/routing/router.py` — Added "nvidia" to `_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER`
  (position 4, after cerebras).
- `static/settings.html` — Added `PROVIDER_COLORS.nvidia` (#76b900) and
  `PROVIDER_DESCS.nvidia`.

## [1.14.2] – 2026-05-21 — Data persistence fix + Enterprise backup system

### 🐛 Critical fixes

- **Redis eviction policy** (`docker-compose.yml`) — Changed from `allkeys-lru`
  to `volatile-lru` and increased max memory from 256 MB to 512 MB. The old
  policy evicted *any* key under memory pressure, including history buckets that
  have no TTL — causing the analytics data loss (400 → 125 visible requests).
  `volatile-lru` only evicts keys that have a TTL set, leaving permanent counters
  safe. Also enabled `appendfsync everysec` for durability.
- **History bucket TTLs** (`app/observability/stats.py`) — 5-min history buckets
  now have a 7-day TTL and hourly buckets have a 30-day TTL, making them immune to
  `volatile-lru` eviction while still expiring stale data naturally.

### ✨ New features

- **Enterprise backup system** (`app/api/backup_api.py`, `static/backup.html`) —
  Full and incremental backups to OCI Object Storage (S3-compatible).
  - Full backup: all `arbiter:*` Redis keys + `data/` directory.
  - Incremental backup: config + gateway tokens + last-48h stats + changed `data/` files.
  - Automatic scheduling: daily incremental at 02:00 UTC, weekly full on Sundays at 01:00 UTC.
  - Retention policy: incremental > 7 days deleted, full > 90 days deleted.
  - Storage quota monitoring: warns at 90% of 10 GB (prefix-scoped to `arbiter/backups/`).
  - Enterprise UI at `/backup` with storage bar, backup list, restore, download, delete.
  - Isolated from other apps sharing the same bucket via strict prefix enforcement.

- **Hourly rollup buckets** (`app/observability/stats.py`) — New
  `arbiter:stats:hourly:{ts}:*` keys (30-day TTL) enable 24h and 7d chart windows.

- **Analytics time-window selector** (`app/api/analytics_api.py`) — `/analytics/data`
  now accepts `?window=1h|4h|24h|7d|30d|90d`. 1h/4h use 5-min buckets; 24h/7d use
  hourly rollups; 30d/90d use daily rollups.

- **Experience-based model routing** (`app/routing/router.py`) — Router now reads
  per-model error rate + avg latency from Redis (cached 5 min) and reorders models
  within each provider group so lower-error / lower-latency models are tried first.
  Provider order is preserved; only intra-provider model order changes.

- **Backup nav entry** (`static/components/sidebar.js`) — Backup & Restore page
  added to the sidebar. Version label updated to v1.14.2.

### 🔧 Dependencies

- `boto3>=1.34.0` added to `requirements.txt` for S3-compatible storage access.

### 🐛 OCI S3 compatibility fix

- **Disable automatic checksums** (`app/api/backup_api.py`) — boto3 >= 1.26 uses
  `aws-chunked` transfer encoding by default for PutObject, which OCI Object Storage
  rejects with `MissingContentLength`. Fixed by setting
  `request_checksum_calculation="when_required"` and
  `response_checksum_validation="when_required"` in the botocore Config, plus
  `payload_signing_enabled: False` for path-style access.

## [1.14.1] – 2026-05-01 — Security hardening + reliability audit (21 issues)

Full end-to-end code audit and remediation. No new features; all changes are
security, correctness, or performance improvements.

### 🔒 Security

- **XSS fix (`app/auth/sso.py`)** — `/auth/pending` HTML response now escapes
  `email`, `status`, and `admin` query parameters via `html.escape()` before
  interpolating them into the page body. A crafted URL with
  `?email=<script>...</script>@x.com` previously executed in the victim's browser.
- **SSRF protection (`app/providers/base.py`)** — `fetch_models()` now validates
  the scheme of `models_discovery_url` with `urlparse` before making the HTTP
  call. Anything other than `http` or `https` raises `ProviderError` immediately,
  blocking `file://`, `gopher://`, and internal network probes.
- **Admin guard on `GET /api/providers` (`app/api/keys_api.py`)** — previously
  any valid bearer token could read the masked key hashes and rate-limit health of
  every provider. Now requires `require_admin`.
- **Admin guard on `GET /settings/routing` and `GET /settings/cache`
  (`app/api/settings_api.py`)** — routing config and cache stats were readable
  by any authenticated caller. Both GET endpoints now require `require_admin`.
- **Request body size limit (`app/main.py`)** — a `limit_request_body` middleware
  checks the `Content-Length` header and returns `413 Request Entity Too Large`
  for payloads > 4 MB. Prevents memory-exhaustion via arbitrarily large JSON.

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- **Cache key collision (`app/cache/cache.py`)** — `make_key()` previously hashed
  only `model + messages`, so two requests with the same prompt but different
  `max_tokens` / `stop` / `top_p` could serve each other's cached responses.
  The key payload now includes all four parameters.
- **Version drift (`app/main.py`)** — the FastAPI constructor and `/health`
  response each hard-coded `"1.12.1"` independently. Both now read a single
  `APP_VERSION = "1.14.1"` constant declared once at module level.
- **Dead auth code (`app/api/chat.py`)** — `_check_auth()` was an incomplete
  duplicate of the middleware enforcement already performed by
  `GatewayAuthMiddleware`. Removed entirely; middleware is the single
  enforcement point.
- **stream returns 400 not 501 (`app/api/chat.py`)** — `stream=true` was
  rejected with `501 Not Implemented`, which caused SDK clients to retry the
  unsupported feature. Changed to `400 Bad Request`.

### ⚡ Performance

- **Non-blocking Redis scans (`app/api/analytics_api.py`)** — all 8 calls to
  `redis.keys()` replaced with `async for key in redis.scan_iter(...)`.
  `keys()` is an O(N) blocking call that stalls the event loop on large
  keyspaces; `scan_iter` uses cursor-based iteration without blocking.
- **`mget` batch for routing config (`app/api/settings_api.py`)** — `GET
  /settings/routing` previously issued 13 sequential `redis.get()` calls for
  per-provider model overrides. Replaced with a single `redis.mget()` round-trip.
  `_InMemoryRedis` gained a matching `mget()` method for local-dev parity.

### ✅ Input validation

- **`ChatCompletionRequest` (`app/models/schemas.py`)** — added Pydantic `Field`
  constraints: `model` max 256 chars, `temperature` ∈ [0, 2], `max_tokens` ∈
  [1, 128 000], `top_p` ∈ [0, 1], `Message.role` max 64 chars.
- **`ImageRequest` (`app/api/image_api.py`)** — added constraints: `prompt` max
  4 000 chars, `negative_prompt` max 1 000 chars, `n` ∈ [1, 4].

### 🔧 Reliability

- **Free-tier keyword accuracy (`app/api/analytics_api.py`)** —
  `_FREE_TIER_KEYWORDS` updated: added `gemini-3.1-flash`, `gemini-3-flash`,
  `gemini-2.0-flash`, `llama4`; removed stale `gemini-flash` alias. Prevents new
  free models being misclassified as paid traffic.
- **Weekly sync robustness (`app/main.py`)** — the `_Stub` duck-typed hack
  replaced with a named `_AppRequest` class with `__slots__ = ("app",)` so any
  future signature drift surfaces as `AttributeError` immediately.

### Files changed

```
app/auth/sso.py          XSS fix: html.escape on 3 query params
app/cache/cache.py       Cache key: add max_tokens, stop, top_p

## [1.14.0] – 2026-05-01 — PWA + Enterprise UI + Tiered cache strategy

### 📱 Progressive Web App (mobile install)

Arbiter is now installable on Android (Chrome / Edge / Samsung Internet),
iOS Safari (Add to Home Screen), and desktop. Open `/dashboard`, then use
your browser's install prompt or the new **Install app** button at the
bottom of the sidebar. Once installed it launches in standalone mode with
its own icon, splash, and offline page.

- New `static/manifest.webmanifest` (id, scope, theme/background colours,
  shortcuts to Dashboard, Playground, Logs, Settings, 5 icon sizes
  including a maskable icon for Android adaptive icons).
- New `static/sw.js` service worker with three-tier strategy:
  1. **API & auth** → network-only (never cached).
  2. **Static assets** (CSS / JS / fonts / icons) → stale-while-revalidate.
  3. **HTML pages** → network-first with offline fallback to
     `static/offline.html`.
- New PWA icon set: `static/icons/arbiter-{icon,maskable}.svg` source +
  `arbiter-{192,512,512-maskable,apple-180}.png` and `favicon.ico`.
- `arbiter.js` auto-injects `<link rel="manifest">`, theme-color,
  apple-touch-icon, mobile-web-app-capable meta tags so every page is
  PWA-ready without copy/paste.
- `beforeinstallprompt` is captured and exposed via the **Install app**
  button in the sidebar (visible only when the browser supports install).
- Service-worker-aware auto-update: when a new SW activates, the app
  silently reloads to pick up the new build.
- Root-scope routes added in `app/main.py`: `/sw.js`,
  `/manifest.webmanifest`, `/manifest.json`, `/favicon.ico`.
- `Service-Worker-Allowed: /` header so the worker can control the whole
  origin while the script lives at root.

### 🛡️ Tiered Cloudflare cache strategy

The middleware now classifies every response into one of three buckets
and emits the right cache directives for each — fixing the long-standing
"Cloudflare leaks logged-in email to anonymous visitors" bug without
sacrificing static-asset performance.

| Class | Routes | Browser | Cloudflare |
|-------|--------|---------|------------|
| **Sensitive** | `/api/*`, `/auth/*`, `/v1/*`, `/logs/*`, `/settings/*`, `/modal/*`, `/cloudflare/*`, `/dashboard/stats`, every HTML page | `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, private` + `Vary: Cookie` | `no-store` (incl. `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control`) |
| **Static assets** | `/static/*`, `*.css/.js/.png/.jpg/.svg/.woff2/...`, `manifest.webmanifest`, `favicon.ico` | `public, max-age=3600, must-revalidate` | `public, max-age=86400` |
| **Service worker** | `/sw.js`, `/service-worker.js` | `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` (browser handles update detection) | `no-store` |

CSP updated to allow `worker-src 'self' blob:` and `manifest-src 'self'`.

### 🎨 Settings UI overhaul (enterprise-grade + responsive)

- **Models tab** — provider rows now show a coloured dot, description,
  ranked priority pill (`#1`, `#2`, ...), context-window chip, and a
  ghost "Refresh from provider" button. Add-row placeholder is dynamic
  (suggests an existing model id from that provider). Empty state shows
  a friendly "provider defaults will be used" card instead of a blank
  panel.
- **Image Gen tab** — model dropdown and size dropdown are now populated
  live from `/v1/images/models` (no more drift between the API catalog
  and the UI). New "Hide watermark" toggle, character-count hint,
  per-feature info rows replace the emoji list, link to the live model
  catalog endpoint.
- **Cache tab** — KPI strip (hit rate, cached entries, hits, misses) +
  effectiveness donut chart, configuration card showing TTL / threshold
  / key prefix / backend, ordered "how it works" explainer, confirmation
  dialog before destructive clear. Backed by the new richer
  `GET /settings/cache` endpoint that returns config + counters in one
  payload.
- Full responsive layout: provider cards reflow to single column under
  768px, KPI grid drops to 2-col then 1-col, image grid adapts,
  add-key/add-model rows stack, topbar collapses verbose labels, model
  context chips hide under 480px.

### ✨ Enterprise polish (`arbiter.css`)

- Consistent `:focus-visible` rings (2px accent, 3px halo).
- Touch-friendly: 42px min-height form controls, 40px buttons on mobile.
- Smooth tab-bar mask-fade edges (hint at horizontal scroll).
- iOS safe-area support: `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for notched devices.
- Standalone-mode tweaks: disable text selection on chrome, keep it on
  inputs, top safe-area padding on the topbar.
- Sidebar overlay backdrop when open on mobile (with blur).
- Print stylesheet — hides chrome, white background, for sharing
  analytics/log views as PDFs.
- Toast container repositions to bottom-edge full-width on phones.

### Files changed

```

---



### 🆕 Per-key tier tagging (`#paid` suffix)

Keys may now declare a billing tier directly in the env-var, enabling the
router to gate paid-only models to billing-enabled accounts while still
rotating free keys for everyday traffic.

```env
# 1 paid + 2 free
GEMINI_API_KEYS=AIza...RLg#paid,AIza...16D0,AIza...7KDk
```

- Untagged keys default to `#free`.
- A key tagged `#paid` can serve **both** free and paid models.
- A `#free` key is **skipped** when a paid-only model is requested
  (no 429 burn on the free quota).
- Tier mapping is read from `.env` AND `/etc/environment` style env-vars so
  docker-compose `env_file` users keep working unchanged.

### 🆕 Paid Gemini frontier models

Added to the Gemini provider catalog (gated behind `#paid` keys):

| Model | Quality | Speed | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | 5 | 3 | Frontier reasoning · 1 M ctx |
| `gemini-3-pro-preview`   | 5 | 3 | Premium · 1 M ctx |
| `gemini-2.5-pro`         | 5 | 2 | Existing · now flagged paid |

### 🔁 Free-tier priority order rebalanced

The Gemini provider's free fallback chain now leads with the newest preview:

1. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` ⭐ **new default** — newest, fast, free
2. `gemini-2.5-flash` — quality bump
3. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` — highest free RPD (1000)
4. `gemini-3-flash-preview` — frontier flash backup
5. `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` — legacy backups
6. *(paid)* `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`

Auto-router scoring for `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` bumped to
`quality=5, speed=5` so it is preferred for free creative/balanced intents.

### 🛠 Implementation

- **`app/config.py`** — `Settings.get_keys()` strips `#tier` suffix; new
  `get_key_tiers(provider) -> dict[key, tier]`.
- **`app/key_management/key_pool.py`** — `KeyPool.__init__(key_tiers=...)`;
  `get_best_key(required_tier=...)` filters keys whose tier (default `free`)
  cannot satisfy the requested tier.
- **`app/routing/router.py`** — checks `provider.paid_models`; if the model is
  in that set, calls `get_best_key(required_tier="paid")`.
- **`app/providers/gemini.py`** — declares `paid_models` set, expanded `models`
  list (9 entries), reordered for new free priority, default model changed to
  `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`.
- **`app/api/keys_api.py`** — hot-reload (`_reload_provider`) propagates tiers;
  `_read_env_keys()` strips `#tier` so the UI displays clean keys.
- **`app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py`** — added 4 new Gemini models
  (3.1-pro-preview, 3-pro-preview, 3.1-flash-lite-preview, 3-flash-preview).
- **`.env.example`** — documents `#paid` suffix syntax.

### ✅ Validation

- Provider self-test (`POST /api/providers/gemini/test`) → uses new default
  `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, returns `OK`.
- `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` request — routed to paid key (KEY1) only;
  free keys (KEY2/KEY3) skipped without burning quota.
- Free key (KEY2) confirmed working on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`.

### 🔄 Dynamic model discovery for OpenAI-compatible providers

The Settings → Models tab "Refresh" button now actually works for most
providers instead of failing with the unfriendly *"edit app/routing/router.py"*
message.  Implemented a shared `BaseProvider.fetch_models()` that honours a
new `models_discovery_url` class attribute and parses the standard
`{"data": [{"id": ...}, ...]}` shape.

Providers wired up (live-tested):

| Provider     | Discovery endpoint                          | Models found |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Cerebras     | `https://api.cerebras.ai/v1/models`         | 4            |
| Groq         | `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/models`     | 16           |
| OpenRouter   | `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`       | 370          |
| HuggingFace  | `https://router.huggingface.co/v1/models`   | 128          |
| Pollinations | `https://gen.pollinations.ai/v1/models`     | 42           |
| Gemini       | `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models` (custom impl filters `generateContent` only) | 38 |
| Z.ai         | `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/models`       | (untested — endpoint declared) |
| Lightning    | `https://lightning.ai/api/v1/models`        | (untested — endpoint declared) |
| Routeway     | (existing custom impl)                      | 192          |
| Custom       | (generic OpenAI provider)                   | varies       |

Cohere and Cloudflare still need bespoke parsers (non-OpenAI shapes); the
UI now shows a friendly explanation: *"Its model list is curated in code; you
can still enable, disable, or reorder individual models from this UI."*

## [1.13.2] – 2026-04-30 — All-models routing & smart key health

### 🚀 Massive model coverage expansion

- `/v1/models` now exposes **106 models** (up from 60) sourced from current
  official documentation across all 10 active providers.
- **Pollinations** (`gen.pollinations.ai`) — auth header upgrade and 28-model
  catalog covering OpenAI / Claude / Gemini / DeepSeek / Qwen / Kimi /
  Mistral / GLM / Grok / Perplexity / Nova / Minimax aliases.
- **Cloudflare** — 17 models incl. Llama 4 Scout, GPT-OSS 120B/20B,
  Kimi K2.6 (262K ctx), GLM-4.7 Flash, Gemma 4-26B, Nemotron-3-120B.
- **Cerebras** — added Llama 3.3-70B, GPT-OSS-120B, Qwen-3-32B.
- **HuggingFace** — switched to `:fastest` routing across Inference Providers.
- **Gemini** — exposed all 5 free-tier models (2.5-flash-lite default,
  2.0-flash-lite, 2.0-flash, 2.5-flash, 2.5-pro).
- **Cohere** — added `command-a-reasoning-08-2025`.
- **OpenRouter** — default flipped from chronically-throttled
  `hermes-3-llama-3.1-405b:free` to `google/gemma-3-27b-it:free`.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Pollinations 401** — Authorization Bearer header now sent on every
  call (Pollinations made auth mandatory in 2026). Verified end-to-end:
  upstream now reaches 402-budget rather than 401-auth.
- **Pollinations key never loaded** — `Settings` was missing the
  `POLLINATIONS_API_KEYS` field, so `get_keys("pollinations")` returned
  empty and the pool fell back to the literal string `"free"`. Added
  the field plus mapping entry in `app/config.py`.
- **Stale Redis disabled flags** for `cloudflare`, `cohere`, `cerebras`
  removed — all three now eligible for routing again.

### 🧠 Smart key-health scoring

- `KeyPool._score_key()` now factors in a 30-min sliding-window
  **success / error ratio** (Laplace-smoothed) alongside RPM / TPM /
  daily availability. Weights rebalanced to
  `RPM 0.25 · TPM 0.15 · Daily 0.40 · Health 0.20`.
- New `KeyPool.record_error(key)` helper bumps the error counter on
  upstream `ProviderError` / unexpected exceptions; flaky keys are
  automatically deprioritised without being hard-cooled.

---

## [1.13.1] – 2026-04-30 — UI consistency + routing fix

### 🐛 Fixed

- **`/analytics` returned 404** — the `analytics_router` was never registered
  in `app/main.py`. The Analytics nav link from v1.13.0 now actually works.
- **Disabled providers were still being routed to** — `IntelligentRouter`
  ignored the `arbiter:runtime:disabled:{name}` flag set by the Settings UI.
  The router now filters disabled providers out of the candidate chain
  (cached for 5s) and surfaces a clear error if the caller pinned a
  disabled vendor explicitly.

### 🎨 Shared sidebar component

- New `static/components/sidebar.js` — single source of truth for
  navigation. Every page now declares only `<aside id="sidebar"></aside>`
  and the script renders the same brand, nav items, and footer everywhere,
  marking the current page active automatically.
- All eight UI pages refactored: `dashboard`, `analytics`, `api-docs`
  (Analytics link was missing here), `settings`, `playground`, `logs`,
  `images`, `users`. Adding a new page or nav item now requires editing
  one file instead of nine.
- Each nav item carries a tooltip describing what the page does.

### 🔢 Sortable tables + tooltips

- New `static/components/ui.js` — drop-in helper that auto-wires
  `<table data-sortable>` with click-to-sort headers (asc/desc, type-aware
  numeric / date / string) and renders polished `data-tip="…"` tooltips.
- Sortable now: Dashboard provider table; Analytics provider, model, and
  per-gateway-token tables; Settings → Gateway Tokens table.
- Tabular cells expose raw `data-sort` values so date-formatted columns
  (Last Used, Created, Expires) sort chronologically rather than
  alphabetically.

---

## [1.13.0] – 2026-04-30 — Per-Token Observability + Strict Auth

### 🔒 Strict / fail-closed gateway auth

- **New env var `REQUIRE_AUTH=true` (default: true)** — when no
  `GATEWAY_API_KEYS` and no dynamic gateway tokens are configured, `/v1/*`
  returns **401** instead of silently passing traffic through. The gateway
  now refuses to make outbound LLM calls without a valid Bearer token.
  Set `REQUIRE_AUTH=false` to opt back into legacy permissive mode.
- **Auth-status banner** on Analytics — bright warning when the gateway is
  running in open mode (`auth_enforced: false` in `/analytics/data`).

### 📊 Per-gateway-token tracking (the bug you saw on the Gateway Keys tab)

Previously the **Requests** column on the Gateway Keys tab and the
`request_count` field always showed `0` because no code path incremented it.
Fixed end-to-end:

- **New module `app/observability/stats.py`** — single source of truth for
  every counter, with consistent key namespacing.
- **`GatewayAuthMiddleware`** now identifies which named token was used and
  attaches `request.state.gateway_token_id` / `…_token_name` so downstream
  handlers can attribute the request.
- **`IntelligentRouter.route()`** accepts `token_id`/`token_name` and writes:
  - `arbiter:stats:token:{id}:requests / success / errors / tokens`
  - `arbiter:stats:token:{id}:provider:{name}:requests`
  - `arbiter:stats:token:{id}:model:{model}:requests`
  - `arbiter:stats:token:{id}:last_used`
- **`GET /api/gateway/tokens`** now merges live counters into each row
  (`request_count`, `success_count`, `error_count`, `tokens_used`,
  `last_used_at`).
- **NEW `GET /api/gateway/tokens/{id}/stats`** — detailed per-token
  analytics with 30-day history, by-provider, and by-model breakdowns.
- **Settings UI** — Gateway Keys table now shows Requests / Tokens / Last
  Used columns with live values.

### 📈 Enterprise-grade analytics filters

- **`GET /analytics/data` now supports**:
  - `from=YYYY-MM-DD&to=YYYY-MM-DD` — daily-rollup time series for any range
    up to 90 days.
  - `token_id=…` — filter to a specific gateway token (or `env` for env-var
    traffic).
  - `provider=…` and `model=…` — drill down to a specific provider or model.
- **New daily rollup keys** (`arbiter:stats:day:{YYYY-MM-DD}:*`) with 90-day
  TTL — efficient `GET` instead of scanning all `history:*` keys.
- **Top-N providers / models / tokens** computed over the filtered range.
- **Latency tracking is now real** — previously `arbiter:stats:latency:*`
  was read by the analytics page but never written. Fixed in the router.
- **Per-token usage table** added to `/analytics`.
- **Filter bar** with date range, gateway-token, provider, and model
  selectors plus 7d / 30d quick presets and a per-range summary card with
  daily sparkline + top-5 providers / models / tokens.
- **Analytics nav item restored** in the sidebar across all pages.

### 🔌 Provider enable/disable UX

- **`POST /api/providers/{name}/enable`** now returns a structured
  `400 {"error":"no_key", …}` body with `key_format`, `key_hint`, and
  `signup_url` when the provider has no key configured. Previously the
  endpoint silently no-op'd, leaving the toggle visually reverted with no
  explanation.
- **Settings UI** — when toggling a key-less provider on, the page now
  prompts for an API key inline, saves it via
  `POST /api/providers/{name}/keys`, and auto-retries enable.
- **Source badge** on each provider card (`env` / `disabled`) so it's clear
  whether keys are coming from `.env` or the UI-disabled state, and you can
  freely disable a provider whose env var is still set — the disable flag
  in Redis takes precedence and persists across restarts.

### 🧪 Tests

- `scripts/test_gateway_token_flow.py` extended to assert that
  `request_count >= 1` and `last_used_at` populate after the AI capability
  tests, and that `/api/gateway/tokens/{id}/stats` returns a non-empty
  summary.

---

## [1.12.1] – 2026-04-26 — Security Hardening

### 🔧 Bearer Auth on Admin APIs (post-release patch)

- **`require_admin` now accepts gateway tokens**: Previously, the admin
  dependency only honoured Google SSO sessions, which prevented automation
  and CI tooling from managing tokens, providers, or routing settings via
  Bearer auth. The dependency now falls back to a registered active gateway
  token (matched against `app.state.gateway_tokens`) when no SSO session is
  present. Anonymous requests still receive **401**, and SSO non-admin
  sessions still receive **403**.
- **OpenAI tool-calling / response_format passthrough on Groq provider**:
  `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`, `response_format`, `seed`,
  `logprobs`, `n`, presence/frequency penalties, etc. are now forwarded to
  Groq verbatim. Assistant `tool_calls`, `function_call`, `refusal`, `audio`
  fields are preserved on the response. Inbound messages preserve
  `tool_calls` / `tool_call_id` / `name` for multi-turn tool-using chats.
- **New end-to-end test**: `scripts/test_gateway_token_flow.py` verifies the
  full token CRUD lifecycle (create → list → page-refresh → PATCH → revoke
  → delete) and exercises every advertised AI capability through a
  freshly-created Bearer token: model listing, auto-routing, multi-turn
  context, function calling (validates `tool_calls` payload), JSON mode
  (parses content as JSON), and vision (multimodal routing). 20/20 pass.

## [1.12.1] – 2026-04-26 — Security Hardening

### � Dependency Vulnerability Patches

Fixed all 13 fixable CVEs reported by `pip-audit` (Dependabot moderate alerts).

### �🔒 Repository-Publish Hardening

Comprehensive security review prior to making the repository public.

- **Hardened `.gitignore`**: now covers `.env*` (with `.env.example` whitelist), `*.pem`, `*.key`, `secrets/`, `credentials.json`, `service-account*.json`, `.modal/`, `data/` (runtime state), `__pycache__/`, `*.py[cod]`, `.venv/`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`, `*.log`, `*.bak`, `TEST-REPORT-*.md`. Previously only 3 lines.
- **Added `.dockerignore`**: prevents `.env`, `.git/`, `__pycache__/`, runtime `data/`, virtualenvs and IDE files from being baked into the Docker image build context.
- **Secret scan (clean)**: tracked tree and full `git log -p` history scanned for the live key patterns of every supported provider (`AIzaSy…`, `gsk_…`, `sk-or-v1-…`, `csk-…`, `hf_…`, `nvapi-…`, `ak-…`, `as-…`, `sk_…`) — zero hits. `.env.example` contains placeholder strings only.

### 🔐 RBAC — Admin-only Configuration Endpoints

All endpoints that mutate provider keys, routing config, gateway tokens, infrastructure (Cloudflare/Modal) or preferences are now gated by `Depends(require_admin)`. Non-admin authenticated users get **403**; unauthenticated requests get **401**.

| Endpoint family                     | Admin-only methods                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `/api/providers/*`                  | POST/DELETE keys, enable/disable, test, reload |
| `/api/gateway/tokens/*`             | All methods (router-level dep)        |
| `/api/preferences/auto-route`       | PUT, /reset                           |
| `/settings/routing`, `/settings/cache` | POST, DELETE                       |
| `/cloudflare/*`, `/modal/*`, `/modal/deploy/*` | All methods (router-level dep) |

Read-only listing endpoints remain available to approved users.

### ✅ Verification

- 7/7 auto-routing tests still passing post-change.
- Free-tier catalog audit: **55 free models across 12 providers**, 8 vision-capable specs (Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, Llama-4-Scout × 2, Mistral Small 3.1 × 2, Gemma-3 12B/27B).
- Container rebuilt clean: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.
- Curl-tested: `/api/users`, `/api/providers/{p}/keys`, `/settings/routing`, `/api/preferences/auto-route`, `/api/gateway/tokens`, `/cloudflare/workers/*` all return 401 unauthenticated.

## [1.12.0] – 2026-04-26

### 🚀 Smart Auto-Routing — `model="auto"`

Arbiter now classifies the incoming prompt and picks the best free-tier model for the job, automatically.  No LLM call, no extra latency (<1ms heuristic classifier).  Fully overridable per-request and per-deployment.

#### New Components

- **[app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py](app/providers/_free_tier_catalog.py)** — single source of truth for all 11 free-tier providers.  Each model is described by a `ModelSpec` with capability tags (`code`, `reasoning`, `long-context`, `vision`, `creative`, `fast`, `balanced`, `large`), modality (`text`/`vision`/`multimodal`), context window, RPM/RPD quota, quality (1–5), and speed (1–5).  Replaces the previous 200-line hardcoded `VENDOR_MODEL_HIERARCHY` block — that dict is now derived from the catalog at import time.  A separate `PAID_FALLBACK_CATALOG` lists Routeway paid models for opt-in fallback.
- **[app/routing/intent_classifier.py](app/routing/intent_classifier.py)** — pure-Python regex/keyword heuristic that maps a request to one of seven intents: `code`, `reasoning`, `long-context`, `vision`, `creative`, `fast`, `balanced`.  Inputs considered (in priority order): explicit `metadata.arbiter_intent` hint → multimodal image part → token-count threshold (>16K → long-context) → code-fence regex → keyword scoring (code keywords weighted 2×) → length fallback.
- **[app/routing/auto_router.py](app/routing/auto_router.py)** — scoring engine that returns an ordered `List[(provider, model_id)]` chain.  Score formula: `cap_score (40 - rank·8) + quality·priority_weight + speed·priority_weight + intent_pref_score`.  Hard filters: vision intent requires `multimodal`/`vision` modality; context window must fit prompt with 10% margin.  Honours user preferences (`prefer_providers`, `avoid_providers`, per-intent model lists, `allow_paid_fallback`) and the model-enabled state from `state_store`.
- **[app/api/preferences_api.py](app/api/preferences_api.py)** — admin-gated REST surface at `/api/preferences/auto-route` (GET / PUT / POST `…/reset`).  Persists to `data/arbiter_state.json` via the existing file-locked `state_store`.

#### New Request Fields & Headers

- `body.model = "auto"` (or empty) — engages the auto-router.
- `body.fallback`: `"none"` (default; preserves the strict-pin contract from v1.11.2), `"same_provider"` (walk other models on the pinned provider), or `"chain"` (cross-provider fallback via auto-router).
- `body.metadata`: free-form dict; recognised keys are `arbiter_intent`, `priority`, `prefer_provider`, `opt_in_paid`.
- Request headers: `X-Arbiter-Priority: speed|quality|balanced`, `X-Arbiter-Prefer-Provider: <name>`, `X-Arbiter-Fallback: none|same_provider|chain` — useful for OpenAI-SDK callers that can't set body extras.
- Response header: `X-Arbiter-Model-Used: <provider>/<model>` — the actual pair that fulfilled the request.

#### Router Changes

- **[app/routing/router.py](app/routing/router.py)** — `route()` now builds a single unified `(provider, model)` candidate chain via `_build_candidate_chain()` instead of nested provider-order × model-hierarchy loops.  Three modes: vendor-pinned (only that vendor) · auto (`auto_candidate_chain`) · explicit-model (strict pin by default; honours `fallback`).  The chosen pair is stamped onto the response object so `chat.py` can echo it via the `X-Arbiter-Model-Used` header.

#### State Store

- **[app/state_store.py](app/state_store.py)** — extended `_DEFAULT_STATE` with `auto_route_preferences` (priority, prefer/avoid lists, six per-intent preference lists, `allow_paid_fallback`).  New helpers `get_auto_route_preferences()` and `update_auto_route_preferences()` validate enum/shape, dedupe, merge, and persist atomically.

#### UI

- **[static/settings.html](static/settings.html)** — new **Auto Routing** tab with priority dropdown, paid-fallback opt-in, prefer/avoid provider inputs, and an advanced collapsible panel for per-intent model preferences.  Live-saves to `/api/preferences/auto-route`.

#### Validation

- **[scripts/test_auto_routing.py](scripts/test_auto_routing.py)** — sends one prompt per intent (`code`, `reasoning`, `long-context`, `creative`, `fast`, `balanced`, `vision`) with `model="auto"` and asserts the `X-Arbiter-Model-Used` header points at a model that owns the expected capability tag.  Live result on this deployment: **7/7 pass**.
  - code → `cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507`
  - reasoning → `cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507`
  - long-context → `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
  - creative → `cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507`
  - fast → `gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite`
  - balanced → `groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
  - vision → `cloudflare/@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`

#### Compatibility

- **Strict-pin contract preserved**: explicit `model="…"` with no `fallback` field still uses *only* that model (the v1.11.2 fix).  Fallback is opt-in.
- **Existing `/v1/chat/completions` semantics unchanged** for callers that don't set `model="auto"`, `fallback`, `metadata`, or any of the new headers.

### ✨ New Provider — Ollama Cloud

- **Ollama Cloud added as an 11th provider** — free personal API key at <https://ollama.com/settings/keys> grants access to 6 large open-weight MoE models through an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (no billing required, server-side rate limits apply).  Models added to the free-first hierarchy (slot between `pollinations` and `routeway`):
  - `gpt-oss:20b-cloud` · 131K ctx · default
  - `glm-4.6:cloud` · 128K ctx
  - `minimax-m2:cloud` · 192K ctx
  - `qwen3-coder:480b-cloud` · 256K ctx · coding specialist
  - `gpt-oss:120b-cloud` · 131K ctx · flagship
  - `deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud` · 164K ctx

  Implementation: [app/providers/ollama_provider.py](app/providers/ollama_provider.py).  Wired through [app/config.py](app/config.py), [app/main.py](app/main.py), [app/api/keys_api.py](app/api/keys_api.py) (‘Ollama Cloud’ card in Settings), and [app/routing/router.py](app/routing/router.py) (hierarchy + default order).  `kimi-k2:1t-cloud` excluded — Ollama upstream returns 500 Internal Server Error consistently.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Systemic silent-default-substitution removed across 8 providers** — discovered via end-to-end audit: Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, Cohere, Cloudflare, Cerebras, Z.ai, and Lightning all silently rewrote `request.model` to `self.default_model` whenever the requested ID wasn't in their hardcoded `self.models` list.  Combined with the cross-provider fallback chain, an unknown / mistyped model would walk through every provider's default until one of them returned 200 — so the caller's pin was completely ignored and the response came from a totally different model.  All eight providers now pass the explicit model through verbatim and only fall back to `default_model` for `"auto"` or empty.  This is the same fix previously applied to HuggingFace, now standardised everywhere.  Verified by `curl -d '{"model":"nonexistent/model",...}'` → returns HTTP 502 with clear "All providers/models/keys failed for model='nonexistent/model'" instead of silently returning gemini-2.5-flash-lite.
- **Explicit model selection now pins exactly** — when the caller named a specific model (e.g. Playground selected the 4th entry in a list), the router's `_model_hierarchy` used a substring-bubble (`requested in m OR m in requested`) that caused false matches (e.g. `gpt-4o` matched `gpt-4o-mini`) and silently fell through to other entries on the first failure. The router now returns a **single-entry hierarchy** for any exact match and passes unknown caller-specified models through as-is. Only the sentinel `"auto"` (or empty model field) triggers the full free-first fallback chain. Fixes: "selected 4th model but response came from 1st/default".
- **HuggingFace provider silently substituted the default model** — if the requested model wasn't in the hardcoded `self.models` list the provider rewrote it to `default_model` before calling HF Router, so every call returned a single model regardless of selection. Removed the rewrite; any model the caller explicitly names is now forwarded to HF verbatim.
- **Pollinations 502 behind Cloudflare** — Pollinations sits behind Cloudflare, which returns **502 Bad Gateway** to bare `httpx/0.x` User-Agent. Added `User-Agent: Arbiter/1.11.2 (+https://github.com/)` to the provider's HTTP client. Also dropped the deprecated legacy model aliases — only `openai-fast` (GPT-OSS 20B on OVH) is reliably reachable anonymously.
- **Routeway 503 no longer cooldown-cascades the whole key** — a single model returning `503` (upstream "no eligible providers") previously raised `RateLimitError`, which cooldowned the shared Routeway API key for 300s and knocked out all 15 `:free` models. 503s (status and in-body `code==503`) now raise `ProviderError` instead, so only that model is skipped and the other free models on the same key stay reachable.

### 🧹 Model Cleanup (verified via live probe × 2)

Pruned consistently-broken models from every provider's fallback hierarchy and default seed lists. Transient-upstream failures were left in place per the "if it's temporary it's fine" rule.

| Provider       | Removed                                                                                                                           | Kept |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| **Gemini**     | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-2.5-flash`                                                     | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (1 working) |
| **Groq**       | `moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct{,-0905}` (returned `model_not_found`)                                                                | 6 working |
| **OpenRouter** | `meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (Venice upstream chronically 429)                                                        | 6 working (same model kept on Routeway) |
| **Cloudflare** | `@cf/moonshot/kimi-k2.5`, `@cf/qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-fp8`, `@cf/deepseek/deepseek-r1-distill-qwen-32b`                                | 8 working |
| **Cerebras**   | `gpt-oss-120b`, `zai-glm-4.7` (not in Cerebras free-tier catalogue)                                                                | 2 working |
| **HuggingFace**| `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`, `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta`, `google/gemma-2-2b-it` (no HF-Router provider)               | 4 working (now includes Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 1B, GPT-OSS 20B) |
| **Pollinations**| legacy `mistral`, `mistral-large`, `openai`, `claude` aliases (deprecated)                                                        | `openai-fast` (1 working) |
| **Routeway**   | `gpt-oss-120b:free`, `gemma-4-31b-it:free`, `kimi-k2-0905:free`, `glm-4.5-air:free`, `minimax-m2:free`, `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free` | 9 free + 7 paid fallback |

Final live probe result: **100% OK on Gemini, Groq, Cohere, Cloudflare, Cerebras, HuggingFace, Pollinations**; OpenRouter and Routeway free models work in isolation but currently show upstream rate-limits (RATE, not failure) that recover automatically.

### 📝 Infrastructure

- `scripts/test_curated_models.py` — probe harness that exercises every curated `(provider, model)` pair against the live gateway and categorises each as `OK | RATE | FAIL`. Re-run after any hierarchy change.

---

## [1.11.1] – 2026-04-24

### ✨ Free-Tier First Strategy

- **Routeway free models added by default** — Routeway tags 15 zero-cost models with a `:free` suffix (verified via their `/v1/models` pricing API: `price_per_million_t == 0`). These are now the default seed list for the Routeway provider and occupy the top slots of its fallback hierarchy, so unbilled accounts can use Routeway out-of-the-box without credits. Paid models (`gpt-4o`, `claude-3-5-sonnet`, etc.) remain available as last-resort fallback. Free models included: `llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free`, `gpt-oss-120b:free`, `kimi-k2-0905:free` (256K ctx), `glm-4.5-air:free`, `minimax-m2:free`, `devstral-2512:free`, `ling-2.6-flash:free`, `step-3.5-flash:free`, `gemma-4-31b-it:free`, `nemotron-3-nano-30b-a3b:free`, `nemotron-nano-9b-v2:free`, `llama-3.1-8b-instruct:free`, `llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free`, `llama-3.2-1b-instruct:free`, `mistral-nemo-instruct:free`.
- **Provider order documented as free-first** — `_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER` in `app/routing/router.py` now carries inline annotations confirming the priority: Gemini → Groq → Cerebras → Z.ai → Cloudflare → OpenRouter → Cohere → HuggingFace → Pollinations → Routeway → Lightning. Paid-only providers (Lightning) are unconditionally last so zero-cost traffic hits free providers first.
- **Routeway default model** changed from `gpt-4o-mini` (paid, 402 without credits) to `llama-3.3-70b-instruct:free` (free tier).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **500 / AssertionError on every UI request when SSO enabled** — Starlette wraps the latest-added middleware as the OUTERMOST layer, so the previous ordering (SessionMiddleware added before GatewayAuthMiddleware) meant GatewayAuth ran *before* Session had populated `request.scope["session"]`, raising `AssertionError: SessionMiddleware must be installed to access request.session` on the first UI hit. Swapped the registration order in `app/main.py` and added a defensive `"session" in request.scope` guard in `get_session_user()` so future reorderings can't resurrect this bug.
- **Login page wrongly showed "Google SSO is not configured" even when it was** — `static/login.html` read `cfg.enabled` but `/auth/config` returns `{"sso_enabled": true, ...}`. Field-name mismatch caused the warning to always appear. Login page now accepts both keys.
- **Playground "Auto (Smart Route)" endpoint** — the playground used to force-pin a single vendor via `?vendor=X` on every request, so when that vendor's keys were on cooldown (e.g. Routeway 402 "Insufficient funds", OpenRouter 429) the request 502'd with no fallback. Added a new top-level **⚡ Auto (Smart Route)** option that omits `?vendor=` and lets Arbiter's router pick the healthiest available provider (exactly what Arbiter is designed for).
- **Misleading 502 "Last error: None"** — when every candidate provider's keys were already on cooldown, the router never attempted a call, so `last_error` stayed `None` and clients saw an empty/useless detail. Router now surfaces a clear `"All keys for provider(s) [...] are currently on cooldown or daily-quota exhausted..."` message.
- **Cooldown-exhaustion now returns HTTP 503** (not 502) — when the failure is "every key is resting" rather than an actual bad upstream response, 503 Service Unavailable is the accurate status code. Makes retries and monitoring more sensible.
- **Routeway / Z.ai missing in Settings UI** — backend was wired correctly, but `PROVIDER_COLORS` and `PROVIDER_DESCS` dicts in `static/settings.html` were missing both providers, so cards rendered with fallback color and no description. Added both entries.
- **Login never prompted** — `.env` had no Google OAuth credentials or `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`, so middleware correctly fell through to open mode. Added a Google SSO block to `.env` with a pre-generated `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`; user only needs to fill `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **`_wants_json()` chained-comparison bug** in `app/middleware/auth.py` — `"*/*" in accept == accept.strip()` was accidentally using Python chained comparison. Replaced with explicit `accept in ("", "*/*")`.

### 🧹 Cleanup

- **Removed Analytics page** — data was fully redundant with the Dashboard. Deleted `static/analytics.html`, `app/api/analytics_api.py`, the `/analytics` route in `dashboard.py`, the `include_router(analytics_router, …)` line in `main.py`, the sidebar nav link, and the `/analytics/` entry in `_wants_json`.

### 🔐 Security Hardening

- **Admin-gated mutating admin endpoints** — added `Depends(require_admin)` on all Custom Providers write/test/probe routes (`POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`, `/test`, `/probe`) and on the Models `/refresh` + `/{model_id}/toggle` endpoints. Previously these were only protected by the global gateway middleware, meaning any approved non-admin Google user could add/remove providers once SSO was on.
- **Session cookie Secure flag enabled by default in prod `.env`** (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true`).
- **CORS allowlist pinned** — `.env` now defaults to `ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS=https://arbiter.chkoushik.com`; wildcard continues to be rejected when SSO is on.

---

## [1.11.0] – 2026-04-23

### 🚀 New Provider — Routeway

- Added **Routeway** provider (`app/providers/routeway.py`) — OpenAI-compatible inference gateway at `https://api.routeway.ai/v1`
- Bearer-token auth, dynamic model discovery via `GET /models`, proper handling of 429 (retry-after) and 402 (quota)
- Wired through `VENDOR_MODEL_HIERARCHY`, `_DEFAULT_PROVIDER_ORDER`, `PROVIDER_LIMITS`, `_ENV_VAR_MAP`, `_PROVIDER_META`, free-tier table
- New env var: `ROUTEWAY_API_KEYS` (comma-separated; multi-key rotation supported)

### 🧩 Custom Providers — Add from the UI

- New **Custom Providers** tab in Settings with preset templates (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Together, Fireworks, Mistral, Perplexity, fully custom)
- `GenericOpenAIProvider` — instance-configured provider supporting both **Bearer** and **Anthropic (x-api-key + /messages)** auth schemes
- API surface (`/api/custom-providers`):
  - `GET  /templates`     — list preset templates
  - `GET  /`              — list configured custom providers
  - `POST /`              — add a new provider
  - `POST /probe`         — test connectivity without persisting
  - `POST /{name}/test`   — run a live probe against an existing provider
  - `PATCH /{name}`       — update label / key / models / base URL
  - `DELETE /{name}`      — remove provider and its API key
- **SSRF protection** — base URL is validated with `ipaddress`; rejects `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, link-local, private IP ranges, and `metadata.google.internal`
- API keys persisted to `.env` as `CUSTOM_PROVIDER_<NAME>_KEY`; the rest of the config lives in `data/arbiter_state.json`
- Custom providers are hot-loaded at startup via `load_custom_providers_to_app()` — no restart needed after adding one

### 🔄 Dynamic Model Discovery — Manual Refresh

- `BaseProvider.fetch_models()` optional method lets any provider expose its live catalogue
- Per-provider **Refresh from provider** button on the Models tab calls `POST /api/models/{provider}/refresh`
- Per-model enable/disable state tracked in `data/arbiter_state.json`
  - Free-tier providers default-enable discovered models
  - Paid-tier discoveries are added as disabled until an admin enables them (quota safety)
- Router `_model_hierarchy()` filters out disabled models; `/v1/models` and `/api/models/info` merge state-store data over the static hierarchy
- **No Redis**, **no periodic polling** — refresh is strictly user-initiated (per user preference: "Redis causes cache issues")

### 🔐 Google SSO + Security Hardening

- **Google OAuth 2.0 sign-in** via Authlib for the admin dashboard and all UI pages
- Dual-mode auth:
  - `/v1/*` endpoints — Bearer-token only (unchanged for API clients)
  - Everything else — Google session cookie; unauthenticated HTML visits are redirected to `/login`, JSON requests receive `401`
- **Approval workflow** — first sign-in from the configured `ADMIN_EMAIL` is auto-approved and marked admin; all other users land in `pending` until an admin approves via `/users`
- `session_version` field on every user → rejecting or deleting a user **revokes their session immediately** on the next request
- New middleware stack (applied in order):
  1. `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` — `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, strict `Referrer-Policy`, tight `Permissions-Policy`, full `Content-Security-Policy`
  2. `CORSMiddleware` — **allowlist** (`ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS`); wildcard `*` is rejected when SSO is on
  3. `SessionMiddleware` (signed cookies, HttpOnly, SameSite=lax, `Secure` in production)
  4. `CloudflareAccessMiddleware` (unchanged)
  5. `GatewayAuthMiddleware` (rewritten, dual-mode)
- `BearerRedactFilter` — log formatter that regex-scrubs `Authorization: Bearer …`, `sk-…`, `gsk_…`, `csk-…`, `hf_…`, `AIza…` tokens before they hit stdout
- New env vars: `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ADMIN_EMAIL`, `APP_BASE_URL`, `SESSION_SECRET_KEY`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, `SESSION_MAX_AGE`, `ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS`
- `/auth/config`, `/auth/me`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/pending` routes
- `/api/users` admin API (list / approve / reject / delete / pre-approve) protected by `require_admin` dependency; admin cannot self-lock-out

### 🗂️ State Store (Disk-backed, No Redis)

- New `app/state_store.py` — JSON-on-disk at `data/arbiter_state.json` with `filelock` + atomic temp-file+rename writes
- Schema: `{version, users[], custom_providers[], models{provider → {model_id → {enabled, discovered_at, is_free, …}}}}`
- `data/` directory mounted as a docker volume so state survives `docker compose down`

### 🎨 UI

- New `/login` — branded Google sign-in page that detects SSO disabled state
- New `/users` — admin-only user management (pending / approved / rejected + pre-approve form)
- Topbar **user chip** with avatar, email, admin badge, Manage-users link, and Sign out — auto-injected into every page by `arbiter.js`
- Admin-only **Users** nav item auto-injected into the sidebar for admins
- Global fetch guard redirects to `/login?next=…` on 401 for UI JSON responses
- Added "Custom Providers" tab + "Refresh from provider" per-provider button in Models tab

### 🔧 Dependencies

- `authlib==1.3.2` (Google OAuth)
- `itsdangerous==2.2.0` (session cookie signing)
- `filelock==3.16.0` (state store concurrency)

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **CORS** — if `GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` is set, `ALLOWED_CORS_ORIGINS=*` is rejected at startup; set an explicit origin list
- **UI 401 behaviour** — HTML visits to protected pages now redirect to `/login` instead of returning JSON. API clients should continue using Bearer tokens against `/v1/*`
- **`SESSION_SECRET_KEY` is required** when SSO is enabled; missing it disables SSO and emits a startup warning

---

## [1.10.0] – 2026-03-30

### 🏗️ Key Storage Refactor — `.env` as Single Source of Truth

- **Removed Redis key storage** — provider API keys were previously stored in both `.env` (at startup) and Redis (added via UI), requiring an explicit "Save to .env" step to persist them across restarts
- **Keys now written directly to `.env`** on every add/remove operation via the UI
- `_read_env_keys()` / `_write_env_keys()` parse `.env` fresh on each call — changes take effect immediately without a restart or Redis sync
- **Auto-creates `.env` from `.env.example`** if no `.env` exists when the first key is added
- Removed `sync-env` endpoint and "Save to .env" button (no longer needed)
- **Delete button shown for all keys** — all keys live in `.env` and are all removable via the UI
- Redis is now used **only** for rate-limit counters and provider disabled/enabled flags

### 🔧 Provider Enable/Disable Flow

- **Test-before-enable** — when the enable toggle is switched on, Arbiter first calls the enable API then immediately runs a connectivity test
  - If test **passes**: provider stays enabled; latency and reply shown in the card
  - If test **fails**: provider is auto-disabled back; toggle reverts; error shown in red — ensures no provider is active with a broken key
- **Fixed stale DOM bug** in `addKey()` — after adding a key, `loadProviders()` re-renders the card grid; the validation result was being written to a detached (removed) DOM node and was invisible. Now re-queries the result element after the re-render.

### ✨ Playground — Markdown Rendering in Chat

- **Assistant chat bubbles now render GFM markdown** using `marked.js v9`
  - Headers, bold, italic, code blocks, inline code, lists, blockquotes, tables, links all rendered as HTML
  - Links open in new tab
  - User messages remain plain text (HTML-escaped)
  - Responsive markdown styles for all elements inside `.chat-msg.assistant`

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- **Modal vLLM startup crash** (`tokenizers` incompatibility) — `tokenizers>=0.21.0` removed `all_special_tokens_extended` which vLLM 0.11.x still accessed; fix: force-reinstall `tokenizers==0.20.3` as a separate image layer after vLLM install
- **Modal `startup_timeout`** increased from 600s to 1200s to accommodate large model downloads
- **Modal live deployment status** — added 5-second polling loop (`setInterval`) when Modal GPU tab is open; previously the deployment list was loaded once and never refreshed
- **Modal endpoint not appearing after deploy** — `loadModalEndpoints()` was only called on tab open; now also called when deployment reaches `active` state and on every 5s poll tick
- **Pollinations image generation 401** — `/v1/images/generations` was not in `_EXEMPT_PATHS`; browser UI requests don't carry Bearer tokens; added it and all UI page routes to exempt list
- **Lightning.ai / Z.ai keys not activating** — both providers were missing from `_reload_provider`'s `_classes` dict; keys were saved but providers were never instantiated; added `LightningProvider` and `ZaiProvider`

### 🎨 CSS / Responsive Fixes

- **Added 5 missing semantic CSS alias variables** to both light and dark themes: `--danger`, `--success`, `--warning`, `--text-1`, `--text-muted` — these were used in 24+ inline styles across pages but never defined, causing invisible/fallback rendering
- **Mobile 480px breakpoint** — added rules to collapse inline `1fr 1fr` grids to single column, fix `#providers-grid` in api-docs, adjust playground chat height

---

## [1.9.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Lightning.ai Provider (LitAI)

- **New provider: Lightning.ai** (`app/providers/lightning_provider.py`)
  - OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `https://lightning.ai/api/v1`
  - **Natively hosted open-weight models** (not available elsewhere):
    - `nvidia/nemotron-3-super` — 256K context, ultra-fast (446 t/s)
    - `lightning-ai/gpt-oss-120b` — flagship 120B model
    - `deepseek/deepseek-v3.1` — 164K context
    - `lightning-ai/gpt-oss-20b` — efficient 20B
    - `meta/llama-3.3-70b` — 128K context
  - **Free tier**: ~37M token welcome credit on signup; then $0.09–$0.52/M tokens
  - **Authentication**: `Authorization: Bearer LIGHTNING_API_KEY`
  - Config: `LIGHTNING_API_KEYS=` in `.env`
  - Integrated into routing, key pool, models API, settings UI

### 🔧 Modal.com — Critical vLLM Template Fix

- **Fixed broken `_VLLM_TEMPLATE`** in `app/api/modal_deploy.py`:
  - **Root cause**: `allow_concurrent_inputs=MAX_CONCURRENT` inside `@app.cls(...)` was **removed in Modal 1.0** (May 2025) — all deployments failed silently
  - **Fix**: Replaced entire template with the official Modal 1.0 pattern:
    - `@app.function(...)` instead of `@app.cls(...)`
    - `@modal.concurrent(max_inputs=MAX_CONCURRENT)` as a separate decorator (Modal 1.0 replacement)
    - `@modal.web_server(port=8000, startup_timeout=600)` instead of `@modal.asgi_app`
    - vLLM runs as a **subprocess** (`subprocess.Popen(["vllm", "serve", ...])`) — uses vLLM's built-in OpenAI-compatible server
    - vLLM version bumped: `>=0.6.0` → `>=0.8.0`; Python 3.11 → 3.12
    - Removed heavyweight deps no longer needed in-process (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `transformers`)
  - The deployed endpoint serves `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/models`, `/health` natively via vLLM
- **Updated GPU prices** (Modal reduced prices since original implementation):
  - T4: $0.36/hr → **$0.59/hr** ($0.000164/s)
  - A10G: $0.72/hr → **$1.10/hr** ($0.000306/s)
  - A100-40GB: $2.16/hr → **$2.10/hr** ($0.000583/s)
  - A100-80GB: $3.40/hr → **$2.50/hr** ($0.000694/s)
- **Added GPU options**: L4 ($0.80/hr) and L40S ($1.95/hr) to `_GPU_MAP` and model catalog
- **Added new model options**: Qwen 2.5 7B on L4 (sweet spot), DeepSeek R1 Distill Llama 8B on T4 (cheapest reasoning)
- **Fixed templates in `modal_manager.py`**: Updated example code to use correct Modal 1.0 patterns; corrected GPU pricing table

---

## [1.8.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Analytics Dashboard (`/analytics`)

- **New dedicated analytics page** — deep usage metrics with Chart.js visualizations
  - Summary KPI cards: total requests, tokens, errors, cache hit rate
  - Per-provider breakdown table: requests, tokens, errors, error rate
  - Per-model breakdown table: per-model request / token / error counts
  - Request history line chart: 5-minute bucket time-series (last 2 hours by default)
  - Provider distribution doughnut chart
  - Reset button to clear all counters
- **Per-model stat tracking in router** (`app/routing/router.py`):
  - `model:{name}:requests` — request count per model
  - `model:{name}:tokens` — token usage per model
  - `model:{name}:errors` — error count per model
  - `history:{bucket}:requests/success/errors` — 5-minute bucket time-series
- **New API** (`app/api/analytics_api.py`):
  - `GET /analytics/data` — returns summary, providers, models, and history arrays
  - `DELETE /analytics/reset` — clears all `arbiter:stats:*` keys
- **Route registered** in `main.py`

### ✨ Dynamic Gateway Token Management (Settings → Gateway Keys)

- **New Gateway Keys tab** in Settings UI — create, revoke, and delete API tokens from the admin panel
  - Token name + optional expiry datetime
  - Plaintext key shown once on creation; copy button provided
  - Revoke (soft-disable) or permanently delete individual tokens
  - Env-var keys shown as a count note; coexist seamlessly with UI-created tokens
- **Tokens active immediately** — no restart required; `GatewayAuthMiddleware` reads `app.state.gateway_tokens` on every request
- **New API** (`app/api/gateway_tokens_api.py`):
  - `GET /api/gateway/tokens` — list tokens (keys masked)
  - `POST /api/gateway/tokens` — create token, returns plaintext key once
  - `DELETE /api/gateway/tokens/{id}` — permanently delete
  - `PATCH /api/gateway/tokens/{id}` — update name / expiry / active flag
  - `POST /api/gateway/tokens/{id}/regenerate` — rotate the key
- **Auth middleware updated** (`app/middleware/auth.py`) to merge static env keys with dynamic `app.state.gateway_tokens`
- **Startup restoration** — `load_gateway_tokens_to_state()` called in `lifespan()` to reload tokens from Redis on restart

### ✨ Playground — Vendor + Model Drill-Down Selection

- **Two-level model picker** in Playground (`/playground`):
  - Vendor dropdown → model dropdown with metadata badges
  - **Free / paid badge** per model (OpenRouter `:free` suffix detection, provider-level free tier flags)
  - **Rate limits displayed**: RPM, TPM, RPD on model selection
  - **Context window** shown per model
- **New API endpoint** `GET /api/models/info` (`app/api/models_api.py`):
  - Returns per-vendor model catalog with rate limits from `PROVIDER_LIMITS` and `VENDOR_MODEL_HIERARCHY`
  - Only configured/active vendors returned
  - OpenRouter free model detection via `:free` suffix

### ✨ Dedicated Image Generation Page (`/images`)

- **New standalone page** `static/images.html` — no longer redirects to Settings
- Left panel: prompt, negative prompt, model selector (from `/v1/images/models`), count 1–4, size selector, seed, enhance toggle
- Right panel: image grid with per-image download / open / copy-URL buttons
- Settings persisted in `localStorage`
- Route `/images` now serves `images.html` directly (previously redirected to `/settings?tab=images`)

### 🐛 Fixes

- **Logs expansion state** preserved across auto-refresh — uses stable `seq` ID instead of array index; expanded rows stay expanded as new records load
- **Image Generation nav link** fixed across all pages (`/dashboard`, `/playground`, `/logs`, `/settings`, `/api-docs`, `/analytics`) — was incorrectly pointing to `/settings` with a `localStorage` tab trick

---

## [1.7.0] – 2026-03-29

### ✨ Z.ai (Zhipu GLM) Provider — Free Tier Support

- **New provider: Z.ai / Zhipu AI** (`app/providers/zai_provider.py`)
  - **Free models**: GLM-4.7-Flash, GLM-4.5-Flash, GLM-Z1-Flash ($0 — completely free)
  - **Context window**: 32K–128K tokens (flash models)
  - **Free-tier limits**: ~10 RPM, ~1000 RPD (verify on z.ai/manage-apikey/rate-limits)
  - **API base**: `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/chat/completions`
  - **OpenAI-compatible**: Same format as other providers

- **Additive Capacity**: GLM-4.7 is now accessible via TWO independent providers:
  - **Cerebras-hosted** `zai-glm-4.7` → 30 RPM (via Cerebras API)
  - **Z.ai-hosted** `glm-4.7-flash` → ~10 RPM (via Z.ai API)
  - **Combined**: ~40 RPM total for GLM-4.7 class requests
  - Router includes both vendors; overlapping models sum their rate limits

- **Audit findings**: Checked all cross-vendor overlaps:
  - Kimi on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate providers)
  - Llama-4-scout on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Qwen on Groq+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Mistral on OpenRouter+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - Gemma-3 on OpenRouter+Cloudflare ✓ (already separate)
  - GLM-4.7 on Cerebras+Z.ai ✅ (now fixed with Z.ai provider)

### 🐛 Router & Cohere Fixes

- **Vendor pin no longer falls back to other providers**:
  - Before: `?vendor=cohere` would try Cohere, then silently fall back to Gemini on failure
  - After: `?vendor=cohere` returns error if Cohere fails (no hidden fallback)
  - Respects user's explicit provider selection
  - Code: `app/routing/router.py:374` — return `[vendor]` only, not `[vendor] + others`

- **Cohere v2 Chat API — System Message Fix**:
  - Before: System messages were extracted from message array and sent as top-level `payload["system"]` field → 422 "unknown field" error
  - After: System messages stay in the messages array with `role: "system"` (Cohere v2 format)
  - Removed extraction pattern; all roles (system/user/assistant) now pass through directly
  - Code: `app/providers/cohere_provider.py:56` — simplified `_build_cohere_messages()` method

### 📊 Key Pool & Rate Limit Fixes

- **Daily counter now tracks requests, not tokens**:
  - Before: `daily_used = 10 + 290 = 300 tokens` after 2 requests → exhausted (daily_limit=33) → locked for 24h
  - After: `daily_used = 1 + 1 = 2 requests` → plenty of room (daily_limit=33)
  - Root cause: All `PROVIDER_LIMITS.daily` values are requests-per-day (RPD), not tokens
  - Fixed: Use `incr` (by 1) for daily, keep `incrby(tokens)` only for TPM
  - Code: `app/key_management/key_pool.py:174` — `record_usage()` method

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

- **Fixed CSS variables** across playground and logs pages:
  - Corrected: `--surface-1` → `--surface`, `--text-muted` → `--text-3`, `--text-primary` → `--text`, `--text-secondary` → `--text-2`
  - Root cause: Pages used wrong variable names; CSS fallback is `initial` → transparent backgrounds
  - All 8 instances updated in both pages' style blocks

- **Fixed layout classes** in HTML structure:
  - `main.main-content` → `div.main-wrapper`
  - `h1.topbar-title` → `h1.page-title`
  - `div.topbar-actions` → `div.topbar-right`
  - `div.content-inner` → `div.page-content`
  - Root cause: Pages didn't match arbiter.css class names

- **Fixed sidebar toggle**:
  - Before: Button had `onclick="toggleSidebar()"` (undefined function) with no `id`
  - After: Button has `id="sidebar-toggle"`, no onclick attribute; arbiter.js wires via event listener
  - Sidebar toggle now works on playground and logs pages

- **Fixed JavaScript errors**:
  - Removed undefined `initTheme()` call (arbiter.js auto-applies theme)
  - Replaced `showToast()` with `toast()` (correct arbiter.js function name)
  - Improved error message fallback to show HTTP status code instead of empty "Error: Error"
  - Code: `static/playground.html:399`, `static/logs.html:496`, `static/logs.html:520`

- **Added responsive CSS**:
  - Tab bar now scrollable on mobile: `overflow-x: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
  - Button size variants: `.btn-sm`, `.btn-xs`, `.btn-danger-ghost`
  - Playground responsive layout for ≤768px: sidebar + chat stack vertically
  - Code: `static/arbiter.css` additions

### 📝 Documentation Updates

- **README.md**: Updated provider count (8 → 9), added Z.ai to feature list and rate limits table
- **Configuration docs**: Added `ZAI_API_KEYS` env var documentation
- **Architecture diagram**: Updated provider flowchart to include Z.ai
- **CHANGELOG.md**: This section

---

## [1.6.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🛠️ CF Workers — Stale-Delete Fix
- **Fixed stale workers after deletion**: After a successful DELETE, a Redis deletion marker (`arbiter:cf:deleting:{name}`, 120s TTL) is set. `list_workers` checks this set and suppresses those workers during the Cloudflare API propagation delay (up to 2 minutes).

### 🔀 CF Workers & Modal — Gateway Routing
- **`cfworker/{name}` model prefix**: Any request to `/v1/chat/completions` with `model: cfworker/<worker-name>` is intercepted before the IntelligentRouter and proxied directly to that worker's `workers.dev` URL via httpx.
- **Virtual models in `/v1/models`**: Active CF workers are exposed as `cfworker/{name}` (owned_by `cloudflare-worker`) and active Modal deployments as `modal/{name}` (owned_by `modal`). Clients can pick these in any OpenAI-compatible tool.

### 🎮 Chat Playground (`/playground`)
- New full-screen chat UI reachable at `/playground` and from the sidebar.
- **Endpoint selector** — grouped dropdown across: Gateway Providers, Cloudflare Workers (live from registry), Modal Deployments (live from registry), Modal Endpoints (registered).
- **Config panel** — system prompt, temperature slider, max tokens.
- **Routing logic per endpoint type:**
  - `cfworker:` → `POST /v1/chat/completions` with `model: cfworker/{name}` (goes through gateway auth)
  - `modal:` with URL → direct `POST {url}/v1/chat/completions`
  - `gateway:` → `POST /v1/chat/completions?vendor={name}`
- **Latency badge** on every assistant message.
- Keyboard shortcut: Enter to send, Shift+Enter for newline.

### 📋 Log Viewer (`/logs`)
- New in-memory log viewer at `/logs` with real-time access to all application logs.
- **`LogBuffer`** Python logging handler (thread-safe deque, max 5,000 records) attached to root logger at startup — captures every module's output.
- **Filters**: level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL), logger name prefix, text search (300ms debounce), time range (since/until).
- **Controls**: tail (last N), limit (100–5000), sort newest/oldest, auto-refresh (2s–30s), copy to clipboard, download as `.txt`, clear buffer.
- **REST API**: `GET /logs/records`, `GET /logs/loggers`, `DELETE /logs/clear`.

### 🔧 Bug Fixes
- Fixed `DeprecationError: container_idle_timeout` → renamed to `scaledown_window` in Modal vLLM template (deprecated 2025-02-24).
- Modal token auto-loaded from `MODAL_TOKEN_ID` / `MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET` env vars; cached to Redis on first use.

### 📚 Documentation
- Updated CHANGELOG, README, DEVELOPER.md, USERGUIDE.md with all Phase 3 features.

---

## [1.5.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🛠️ Cloudflare Workers — List & Delete Fixes

- **Fixed stale cleanup race condition**: Newly created workers are now stored in Redis with `status: "provisioning"`. The list endpoint respects a 120-second grace period so workers won't be incorrectly removed from the registry while the CF API is still propagating them.
- **Provisioning state visible in UI**: Workers show a "◌ Provisioning…" badge immediately after creation and auto-refresh every 3 seconds until CF confirms the worker.
- **Improved delete**: Optimistic UI update hides the worker immediately on successful DELETE; detailed CF API error messages (including 403 permission denied) are shown in a toast.
- **Better error messages**: CF API errors now extract the human-readable `errors[].message` from the JSON response body, not the raw HTTP body.
- **Workers sorted newest first**: Deployed workers list is now sorted by `created_on` descending.

### 🔑 API Key Validation (all providers)

- **New endpoint: `POST /cloudflare/validate`** — Checks three Cloudflare token permissions without side effects:
  - `Workers Scripts Read` → listing and managing worker scripts
  - `Workers AI Execute` → AI inference
  - `Workers Subdomain` → enabling workers.dev routing
  - Returns a permission matrix with HTTP status codes, notes, and recommendations.
- **Auto-validate on key add**: When a Cloudflare key is added in Settings → API Keys, the UI automatically runs permission validation and displays a ✅/❌ matrix per permission.
- **Validate button**: Existing Cloudflare keys can be re-validated anytime via the "Validate Permissions" button on the provider card.
- **Generic test on add**: Other providers (Gemini, Groq, etc.) run the existing `POST /api/providers/{name}/test` probe immediately after a key is saved, showing latency and a sample response.

### 🚀 Modal.com — One-Click vLLM Deploy

- **New endpoints:**
  - `POST /modal/deploy` — Start a background deployment (returns `deploy_id` immediately)
  - `GET /modal/deploy` — List all deployments with status
  - `GET /modal/deploy/{id}` — Deployment status + live log lines (poll every 2s)
  - `DELETE /modal/deploy/{id}` — Stop Modal app + remove from gateway pool
  - `POST /modal/deploy/account` — Save Modal account token (ak-id:secret)
  - `GET /modal/deploy/account` — Check token status
  - `GET /modal/deploy/models` — Curated catalog (10 models, T4→A100-80GB)
  - `GET /modal/deploy/check` — Verify Modal CLI availability + token configured
- **Pre-flight check**: `POST /modal/deploy` now validates `modal` CLI is in PATH before starting; returns a clear 400 error with install instructions if missing.
- **CLI status banner**: Modal GPU tab shows a warning banner if `modal` CLI is not found or no account token is configured.
- **Cost-optimised vLLM template**: `modal.Volume` weight caching, `@modal.concurrent`, `container_idle_timeout`, `gpu_memory_utilization=0.90`.
- **Auto-registration**: On deployment success, the endpoint URL is automatically registered in the Modal endpoint pool and gateway key pool — no manual step.
- **Live log streaming**: Deployment logs streamed to Redis; frontend polls `GET /modal/deploy/{id}` every 2s.

### 📚 Documentation

- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with all v1.4 and v1.5 changes
- `DEVELOPER.md` — new API endpoints documented
- Cloudflare `cloudflare_manager.py` docstring updated with required token permissions
- `modal_deploy.py` docstring documents all routes and deployment flow

---

### 🎨 Settings UI — CF Workers & Modal GPU tabs

- CF Workers: model dropdown from live CF API, analytics button, URL display with copy, active/no-route badge
- Modal GPU: endpoint registration, test, delete; vLLM deployment template
- Models tab: fixed blank model names (was treating `{model, context_window}` dict as array)

---

## [1.3.0] – 2026-03-28

### ✨ Runtime API Key Management (no restart required)

- **New endpoint group: `GET/POST/DELETE /api/providers/*`**
  - `GET /api/providers` — list all providers with status, masked keys, pool stats
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/keys` — add a key at runtime (stored in Redis)
  - `DELETE /api/providers/{name}/keys/{hash}` — remove a runtime-added key
  - `POST /api/providers/{name}/enable` — re-enable a disabled provider

- Keys added via the UI are stored in Redis (`arbiter:runtime:keys:{provider}`) and
  merged with `.env` keys automatically; no container restart needed.
- Enable/disable state stored in Redis (`arbiter:runtime:disabled:{provider}`).
- Env-var keys are shown as read-only (source: `env`); runtime keys can be deleted.

### 🖼️ Image Generation (Pollinations.ai — free, no key required)

- **New endpoints:**
  - `POST /v1/images/generations` — OpenAI-compatible image generation
  - `GET /v1/images/models` — list available image models
- Backed by Pollinations.ai FLUX models: `flux`, `flux-realism`, `flux-anime`, `flux-3d`, `flux-cablyai`, `turbo`
- Supports: prompt, negative prompt, model, size (up to 2048×2048), count (1–4), seed, AI enhance
- Returns image URLs (Pollinations renders lazily on first access)
- Completely free — no API key, no credit card

### 🎨 Settings UI — Full Overhaul

- **API Keys tab** (new, shown first):
  - Per-provider cards with status badge, enable/disable toggle, test button
  - Masked key list with source label (`env` or `runtime`)
  - Add key form with format hint per provider

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- Added `app/api/keys_api.py` (new) — provider management router
- Added `app/api/image_api.py` (new) — image generation router
- `app/main.py` — registers `keys_router` and `image_router`
- `app/middleware/auth.py` — exempts `/api/providers/*` and `/v1/images/models` paths

---

## [1.2.0] – 2026-03-28

### 🎨 Enterprise UI/UX Overhaul

- **Shared design system** — `static/arbiter.css` and `static/arbiter.js` loaded by all pages
  - Consistent CSS custom properties for colors, spacing, radius, shadows
  - Sidebar (240 px fixed), topbar (56 px), main content area
  - KPI cards, chart grid, stat rows, progress bars, tables, badges, drag list, toast, tabs, accordion
- **Light / Dark mode**
  - System preference detection (`prefers-color-scheme`)
  - Manual toggle persisted in `localStorage` (`arbiter-theme`)
  - Applied immediately on `<html>` before paint (no FOUC)
- **Unified single-site navigation** — identical sidebar across all three pages
- `app/main.py` — added `StaticFiles` mount at `/static/`
- `app/middleware/auth.py` — exempt paths starting with `/static/`

### 📊 Dashboard (`/dashboard`) — Rewrite

- 4 KPI cards: Total Requests, Success Rate, Cache Hit Rate, Cached Entries
- Chart.js **line chart** (request history, 20 data points stored in `localStorage`) + **doughnut chart** (provider distribution)
- Provider Status table with health badges
- **Key Details accordion** — per-provider, collapsible; shows hash, status badge, score bar, RPM/TPM/daily mini-bars
- 10-second auto-refresh via `/dashboard/stats`
- Live status pill and last-update timestamp in topbar

### 📚 API Docs (`/api-docs`) — Rewrite

- 5-tab layout: Overview, Authentication, Endpoints, Playground, Providers
- **Live playground** — vendor/model select, temperature slider, system/user messages, response panel with token usage
- Providers tab loads real data from `/settings/routing`
- Model list loads from `/v1/models`

### ⚙️ Settings (`/settings`) — New page

- **Routing tab** — drag-to-reorder provider priority list
- **Models tab** — per-provider model hierarchy management (add/remove/reorder)
- **Cloudflare Workers tab** — list, create, delete deployed Workers
- **Cache tab** — stats display + clear cache button

### 🛠️ Settings Management API

- `GET /settings/routing` — current routing config (provider order + model overrides)
- `POST /settings/routing` — save custom provider order and/or model overrides to Redis
- `DELETE /settings/routing` — reset to built-in defaults
- `DELETE /settings/cache` — clear all `arbiter:cache:*` keys from Redis

### 🔧 Router — Runtime Config Support

- `IntelligentRouter` reads custom config from Redis (`arbiter:config:provider_order`, `arbiter:config:models:{provider}`)
- 30-second in-memory cache on router to avoid per-request Redis reads
- `_provider_order()` and `_model_hierarchy()` accept optional `cfg` dict from Redis

### 🚫 Cache-Control Headers

- All HTML endpoints (`/dashboard`, `/api-docs`, `/settings`) now return:
  `Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate` + `CDN-Cache-Control: no-store`
- Prevents Cloudflare CDN from caching stale UI after deployments

### ✅ Multi-Account Key Pool Management

- **Support multiple API keys per provider** — Distribute load across accounts
- **Weighted Availability Scoring Algorithm**:
  - Daily remaining quota: 50% weight (most critical)
  - RPM headroom: 30% weight
  - TPM headroom: 20% weight
  - Score formula: `(rpm_avail × 0.30) + (tpm_avail × 0.20) + (daily_avail × 0.50)`
- **Automatic key selection** — Pick the key with highest score
- **Per-key rate-limit tracking** — Redis-backed sliding windows:
  - RPM: 60-second rolling window
  - TPM: 60-second rolling window
  - Daily: 24-hour window
- **Graceful degradation** — Failed keys get 5-minute cooldown
- **Per-key stats** — View usage, quotas, and health in dashboard

### ✅ Intelligent Two-Level Routing Engine

**Level 1: Provider Selection**
- **Token-aware**: Large contexts (>100K tokens) → Gemini; Medium (16K+) → Gemini/OpenRouter; Small (<4K) → Groq
- **Capability-aware**: Code tasks → Gemini Pro / Groq 70B; General → Gemini Flash
- **Explicit routing**: Model name contains "gemini" → use Gemini; "llama" → Groq, etc.
- **Default priority**: Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter → Cohere

**Level 2: Model & Key Fallback**
- **Model hierarchy per vendor** — Try best fit first, fall back through hierarchy
- **Key rotation** — Try all accounts for same model before moving to next model
- **Cross-vendor fallback** — Only move to next vendor after exhausting current one
- Example flow:
  ```
  Gemini flash (account 1) → Gemini flash (account 2) → Gemini pro → Groq → OpenRouter → Cohere
  ```

**Model Hierarchies** (by vendor):

*Gemini (1M context):*
1. `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` (fastest, highest quota)
2. `gemini-2.5-flash` (balanced)
3. `gemini-2.5-pro` (highest quality)

*Groq (131K context):*
1. `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (fastest)
2. `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` (best quality)
3. `llama-4-scout-17b` (newest)
4. `qwen/qwen3-32b` (high RPM)
5. `moonshotai/kimi-k2` (high RPM)
6. `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
7. `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

*OpenRouter (128–131K context):*
1. `llama-3.3-70b:free` (quality)
2. `hermes-3-405b:free` (size)
3. `gemma-3-27b:free` (quality)
4. `mistral-small-3.1:free` (balanced)
5. `gemma-3-12b:free` (lighter)
6. `qwen3-4b:free` (fast)
7. `llama-3.2-3b:free` (smallest)

*Cohere (128–256K context):*
1. `command-r7b-12-2024` (fastest)
2. `command-r-08-2024` (balanced)
3. `command-r-plus-08-2024` (best quality)
4. `command-a-03-2025` (newest)

### ✅ Semantic & Exact-Match Caching (Redis)

- **Cache all responses** with `temperature ≤ 0.3` (deterministic)
- **SHA-256 hash key** based on model + messages
- **Configurable TTL** — Default 1 hour (3600s)
- **In-memory fallback** — Gateway works without Redis
- **Instant cache hits** — Same request returns cached response instantly
- **Transparent to client** — Caching is automatic
- **Cache stats** — Dashboard shows hit rate, size

### ✅ Production-Ready Observability

**Web Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)
- Dark-themed, auto-refreshing every 10 seconds
- **Top KPIs**: Total requests, success rate, cache hit rate, cached responses
- **Request breakdown**: Total, successful, failed
- **Cache statistics**: Hits, misses, hit rate, stored responses
- **Per-provider table**: Name, status (healthy/degraded/unavailable), active accounts, requests, success rate, models
- **Per-account table** with per-key details:
  - Account hash (anonymized)
  - Status badge (active/limited/failed/exhausted)
  - **Availability score** (0–100%) with color-coded progress bar
  - RPM usage bar (used/limit)
  - TPM usage bar (used/limit)
  - Daily token usage bar (used/limit)

**JSON Stats API** (`/dashboard/stats`)
- Programmatic access to all dashboard data
- Real-time counters

**Health Check** (`/health`)
- Status: online/degraded
- Redis connection status
- Active providers list
- Version info

**Logging**
- Structured logging to stdout/stderr
- Configurable log level (DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR)
- Request timing in response headers (`X-Response-Time-Ms`)

### ✅ Docker & Containerization

**Dockerfile**
- Based on `python:3.12-slim`
- Minimal footprint
- Secure defaults (no root)

**Docker Compose**
- Two services: `gateway` + `redis`
- Redis persistence with AOF mode
- Health checks on both services
- Bind mounts for live code reload (dev)
- Automatic service dependency management

### ✅ Rate-Limit Protection

- **Per-provider conservative limits** in `PROVIDER_LIMITS`
- **Per-key sliding-window tracking** (RPM, TPM, daily)
- **Hard exclusions** for:
  - Expired daily quotas (wait until next day)
  - Failed keys on 5-minute cooldown
- **Soft throttling** for RPM saturation (delay/queue within same minute)
- **Graceful fallback** when a key hits limits:
  - Try next best key (same model)
  - Try next model in hierarchy
  - Try next provider
- **Error transparency** — Clear error messages about rate limits

### ✅ Configuration & Secrets Management

- **Environment-based configuration** (`.env` file)
- **No hardcoded secrets** — All keys from env vars
- **Multi-key support** (comma-separated)
- **Per-provider customization**:
  - Redis URL
  - Cache TTL
  - Log level
  - API key pools
  - Optional gateway authentication

### ✅ API Key Security

- **Keys never logged** — MD5 hash (first 10 chars) used in logs/Redis
- **Per-account scoring** — Keys can be invalidated without affecting others
- **Automatic rotation** — Cooldown on failed keys (5 min) then retry
- **No credentials in responses** — Only model/metrics returned to client

### ✅ Error Handling & Resilience

- **Graceful degradation**:
  - Redis unavailable → Use in-memory fallback (dev-safe)
  - Provider down → Try next provider
  - Key quota exceeded → Try next key
  - All options exhausted → Clear error message
- **Request validation** — Reject malformed requests with 400 Bad Request
- **Timeout protection** — HTTP timeouts per provider (30–90s)
- **Retry logic** — Automatic retries for transient failures

### ✅ Middleware & HTTP Features

- **CORS** — Permissive (all origins) for self-hosted deployment
- **Request timing** — `X-Response-Time-Ms` header on all responses
- **Structured errors** — JSON error responses matching OpenAI format
- **Optional gateway auth** — `Authorization: Bearer` header support

   - Cross-vendor fallback (guaranteed success if any provider has quota)

3. **Semantic Caching** (vs. no caching)
   - 40–60% quota savings on deterministic requests (temp ≤ 0.3)
   - Instant responses for repeated requests
   - Transparent to caller

4. **Per-Key Tracking** (vs. per-provider)
   - Supports unlimited accounts per provider
   - Fine-grained quota visibility
   - Precise rate-limit enforcement

5. **In-Memory Fallback** (vs. hard dependency on Redis)
   - Works without external services in dev
   - Graceful degradation in production
   - Faster startup
